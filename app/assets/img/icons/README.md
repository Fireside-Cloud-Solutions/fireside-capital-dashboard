# PWA Icons Needed

The PWA manifest (`manifest.json`) references the following icons that need to be created:

## Required Icons
- `icon-192x192.png` — 192x192px PNG (minimum for PWA)
- `icon-512x512.png` — 512x512px PNG (required for "maskable" icons)

## Design Guidelines
- **Source:** Use Fireside Capital logo/branding
- **Colors:** Primary #01a4ef (blue), accent #f44e24 (orange)
- **Background:** Should work on both light and dark backgrounds
- **Maskable:** Icons should have safe zone (center 80%) for Android adaptive icons

## Tools
- Generate at: https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- Or use Figma/Photoshop to create base icon, then resize

## Current Status
❌ Icons not created yet — PWA manifest exists but app won't be installable until icons are added
