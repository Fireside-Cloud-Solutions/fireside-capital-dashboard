# URGENT: Design Direction Update

**Date:** 2026-02-01 12:09 EST

## Correction to Design Brief

The **black primary / red outline** color scheme mentioned in your task was a USER SUGGESTION, **NOT a directive**.

## Actual Requirements

1. **Stay true to Fireside brand identity**
   - Reference the logo
   - Maintain Fireside look and feel
   - Preserve brand colors and personality

2. **You have design autonomy**
   - Audit the current design
   - Identify what works and what doesn't
   - Propose improvements within brand guidelines
   - Fix the "too much red" problem creatively

3. **Goal: Refine, not replace**
   - Enhance the existing Fireside aesthetic
   - Reduce red overuse (user complaint)
   - Improve visual hierarchy
   - Make it feel polished and cohesive

## Action Required

- Study the Fireside brand (logo, current colors, personality)
- Propose a refined color scheme that improves UX while respecting the brand
- Don't blindly implement the black/red suggestion
- Use your design expertise to recommend what's best

**You are the design expert. Propose what YOU think will work best within these constraints.**
