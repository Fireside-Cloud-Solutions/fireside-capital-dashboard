## What Was Done

### 1. Status Check & Context Gathering
- ✅ Read STATUS.md — confirmed 6/11 pages audited (Dashboard, Assets, Bills, Investments, Debts, Reports)
- ✅ Listed audit files in reports/ — identified Settings as next target
- ✅ Read previous Settings audit (Feb 13, 2026) — 5 issues documented (ISSUE-SET001 through SET005)
- ✅ Read settings.html (15.7 KB) — reviewed page structure
- ✅ Checked git log for Settings changes since Feb 13 — found infrastructure improvements (inline CSS extracted, scripts optimized)

### 2. Settings Page Audit
- ✅ Reviewed page header structure (proper .page-header ✓)
- ✅ Checked button hierarchy (primary button for save ✓)
- ✅ Analyzed form validation (min/max attributes present, but no JS validation hints ✗)
- ✅ Checked for empty state (missing for new users ✗)
- ✅ Reviewed save feedback (#settingsStatus span exists but never populated ✗)
- ✅ Analyzed feature completeness (only 1 setting, severely under-featured ✗)
- ✅ Verified password reset modal (present but hardcoded to Settings page, should be global ✗)
- ✅ Checked for inline styles (found 1 instance in section heading ✗)

### 3. Issues Documented
**6 New Issues Created:**
1. **FC-UIUX-023** (P2, 12-16h) — Settings page severely under-featured (missing 5 essential sections)
2. **FC-UIUX-024** (P2, 20 min) — No save state feedback (loading/success/error)
3. **FC-UIUX-025** (P2, 30 min) — No form validation hints for Emergency Fund Goal
4. **FC-UIUX-026** (P2, 30 min) — Missing empty state for new users
5. **FC-UIUX-027** (P3, 2 min) — Inline style on section heading
6. **FC-UIUX-028** (P3, 1h) — Password reset modal should be global component

**Previous Issues Status Check:**
- ISSUE-SET001 → FC-UIUX-023 (NOT FIXED since Feb 13)
- ISSUE-SET002 → FC-UIUX-026 (NOT FIXED since Feb 13)

## Key Findings

### Settings Page Grade: B- (75/100)

**Wins:**
- ✅ Proper page header structure (matches design system)
- ✅ Clean, minimal UI with good spacing
- ✅ Password reset flow included
- ✅ Strong accessibility (labels, ARIA, semantic HTML)
- ✅ Rate limiting on save action
- ✅ Responsive design

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Severely under-featured** — Only 1 configurable setting (Emergency Fund Goal)
   - Missing: Notifications, Account Security, Display Prefs, Data Management, Privacy
   - Users expect 20+ settings in a finance app, we have 1
   - Confusing: notification bell in header but no notification preferences

2. **No save feedback** — Users can't tell if changes saved successfully

3. **No form validation hints** — Can enter $0 or $999,999,999 with no warnings

4. **No empty state** — New users see empty input with no educational context

5. **Minor code quality issues** — Inline styles, modal placement

### Quick Wins Available
**1.5 hours of work addresses 4/6 issues:**
- FC-UIUX-024: Add save feedback (20 min)
- FC-UIUX-025: Add validation hints (30 min)
- FC-UIUX-026: Add empty state (30 min)
- FC-UIUX-027: Remove inline style (2 min)

### Long-term Work
**12-17 hours to bring Settings to feature parity:**
- FC-UIUX-023: Expand with 6 essential sections (12-16h)
- FC-UIUX-028: Refactor password reset modal (1h)

**Core UX Issues:**

## Comprehensive Audit Progress

**Complete:** Dashboard, Assets, Bills, Investments, Debts, Reports, **Settings** (7/11 — 64%)  
**Remaining:** Budget, Transactions, Income, Friends (4/11 — 36%)
