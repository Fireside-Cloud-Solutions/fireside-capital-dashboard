**Cron Job:** sprint-dev (a54d89bf-1328-47bf-8cbb-e13ca14d056d)  
**Agent:** Capital (Lead Dev role)  
**Duration:** 20 minutes  
**Status:** ✅ Complete — P0 Dashboard Empty States Fixed

---

## Session Summary

**Task:** Check Azure DevOps + Discord channels for highest priority work, then fix it

**What I Found:**
- Azure CLI not installed (couldn't access Azure DevOps directly)
- GitHub issues empty (no open issues)
- Recent UI/UX audit (Feb 9, 4:29 AM) identified 3 P0 issues on dashboard
- Most recent commits already fixed FC-078 (page header) and FC-077 (charts)

**Highest Priority Available:**
- **Dashboard P0 Issue #2: Empty State Failure**
- Blocking new user onboarding
- Subscriptions + Upcoming Payments widgets showing loading spinners or blank text
- Clear fix pattern documented in UI audit report

---

## Implementation

**Files Modified (3):**
1. `app/assets/js/empty-states.js` (+20 lines)
   - Added `subscriptions` empty state config
   - Added `upcomingPayments` empty state config

2. `app/assets/js/subscriptions.js` (+8 lines)
   - Updated `loadSubscriptionWidget()` to use `generateEmptyStateHTML('subscriptions')`
   - Added fallback if utility not loaded

3. `app/assets/js/app.js` (+8 lines)
   - Updated `renderUpcomingPayments()` to use `generateEmptyStateHTML('upcomingPayments')`
   - Refactored ternary to proper if/else for clarity

**Total Changes:** +36 lines, 0 deletions

## Documentation

**Updated Files:**
- ✅ STATUS.md — Added SESSION 0455 at top (latest status)
- ✅ memory/2026-02-09-sprint-dev-0455.md (this file)

## Outstanding Work

**Remaining Dashboard P0 Issues (from UI/UX audit):**
1. ✅ Issue #2: Empty State Failure — **FIXED** (this session)
2. ❌ Issue #1: Visual Hierarchy Confusion (all stat cards look the same)
3. ❌ Issue #3: Mobile Header Collision (< 375px screens)

**Next Sprint Dev Session Should:**
- Tackle Dashboard P0 Issue #1 (visual hierarchy)
- OR continue UI/UX audit on remaining 9 pages
- OR address Assets page P0 issues

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Azure CLI missing** — Need to install or find alternative for Azure DevOps access
2. **UI/UX audit reports are gold** — Clear problems, clear fixes, clear ROI
3. **Empty-states.js is well-designed** — Easy to extend with new types
4. **Small fixes, big impact** — 36 lines of code unblocks critical user journey
