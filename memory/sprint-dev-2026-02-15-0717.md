# Sprint Dev Check — 2026-02-15 07:17 AM

**Agent:** Capital (Lead Dev)  
**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE — 2 bugs fixed, committed, pushed

---

## What I Did

### 1. Checked Azure DevOps
- Azure CLI not installed, REST API requires authentication
- Relied on BACKLOG.md instead

### 2. Checked Discord Channels for Issues
- **#qa**: Recent FC-131 pagination review identified 3 bugs (BUG-TRANS-001/002/003)
- **#ui-ux**: All UI/UX work complete, no violations
- **#research**: All research topics complete

### 3. Fixed BUG-TRANS-001 (P2, 15 min)
**Problem:** Filter state not persisted across pagination  
**Solution:** Added `activeFilters` module-scope variable, updated pagination event listeners to pass filters

**Changes:**
- `app/assets/js/transactions.js`: Added `let activeFilters = {};`
- `app/assets/js/transactions.js`: Updated prevBtn/nextBtn/itemsPerPageSelect listeners to pass `activeFilters`
- `app/transactions.html`: Updated applyFiltersBtn to store in `activeFilters`
- `app/transactions.html`: Updated clearFiltersBtn to reset `activeFilters = {}`

### 4. Fixed BUG-TRANS-002 (P3, 5 min)
**Problem:** Pagination controls visible when filtered results are empty  
**Solution:** Call `updatePaginationUI()` before early return when table is empty

**Changes:**
- `app/assets/js/transactions.js`: Added `updatePaginationUI()` call before return in empty state handler

### 5. Committed and Pushed
```
commit 1b4c5b8
Fix BUG-TRANS-001 & BUG-TRANS-002: pagination filter persistence + empty state controls
```

### 6. Updated Backlog
- Marked BUG-TRANS-001 as Done
- Marked BUG-TRANS-002 as Done

## Next Steps

### Remaining Work
- **BUG-TRANS-003** (P2, 30 min): Mobile pagination layout testing — needs device testing on iPhone SE / Galaxy Fold

### Sprint Status
- ✅ 2 bugs fixed in this session
- ⚠️ 1 bug remaining (mobile testing required)

---

## Notes
- Azure DevOps access blocked (auth required)
- Working from BACKLOG.md + Discord channels + QA reports
- Both fixes were straightforward and low-risk
- Changes deployed via CI/CD (Azure Static Web Apps)
