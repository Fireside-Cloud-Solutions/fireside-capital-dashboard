# Sprint Dev Session — FC-033 Fix
**Date:** 2026-02-04 09:03-09:06 AM EST  
**Agent:** Capital (Lead Dev)  
**Task:** Fix FC-033 — Debts table responsive layout issue

---

## Trigger
Cron job `sprint-dev` — checks SPRINT-BOARD.md for highest priority queued task

## Task Claimed
**FC-033:** Debts table Name column squeezed on mobile (8 columns competing for space)

## Analysis
**Root cause:** Debts table has 8 columns:
1. Name (flexible, gets squeezed)
2. Type (fixed)
3. Amount (fixed)
4. Interest (fixed)
5. Term (fixed) ⬅ LOW PRIORITY
6. Monthly Pmt (fixed)
7. Next Due (fixed) ⬅ LOW PRIORITY
8. Actions (fixed)

**Recommended solutions:**
- Option A: Add min-width to Name column (quick fix, still cramped)
- **Option B: Hide Term & Next Due on mobile** (best UX, 30 min)
- Option C: Convert to card layout on mobile (best, 2-4 hours)

**Decision:** Implemented Option B — hide low-priority columns on mobile

---

## Implementation
### Files Modified
1. **app/debts.html** (lines 145-153)
   - Added `class="hide-mobile"` to Term and Next Due `<th>` elements

2. **app/assets/js/app.js** (lines 1128-1137)
   - Added `class="hide-mobile"` to Term and Next Due `<td>` elements in renderDebts()

3. **app/assets/css/responsive.css** (lines 85-92)
   - Added CSS rule: `.table .hide-mobile { display: none !important; }`
   - Reduced table min-width from 600px → 500px (fewer columns on mobile)

### Result
On mobile (<768px):
- **Before:** 8 columns squeezed → Name truncated ("BMW PAY...")
- **After:** 6 columns displayed → Name has full space

Columns hidden on mobile: Term, Next Due (accessible in edit modal if needed)
