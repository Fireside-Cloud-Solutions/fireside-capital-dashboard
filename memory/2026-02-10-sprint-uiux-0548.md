## Key Insights

### Major UX Problem
The Debts page tries to serve two audiences:
1. **Simple debt tracking** — People who just want to list credit cards/loans
2. **Advanced financing** — People who want amortization schedules and payoff plans

This creates confusion. Users don't know which section to use. Recommendation: Clarify OR merge.

### Feature Discovery Issue
The amortization modal is powerful (payment schedules, principal/interest breakdown, payoff date) but hidden behind a tiny text link. Most users never discover it.

### Empty State Gap
Both the Debts table AND the Financing cards have no empty states. New users see nothing and don't understand what these features do.

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- ✅ Audit complete
- ✅ Reports generated
- ✅ Discord updated
- ✅ STATUS.md updated

### Next Sprint UI/UX (5:48 PM EST)
1. Continue with Budget page (if not already audited in detail)
2. Check if any Debts issues were implemented
3. Browser test verification
4. Consider re-auditing earlier pages for missed issues

### Recommended for Builder
1. Fix empty states (Issues #25, #26) — 2 hours
2. Promote amortization feature (Issue #27) — 2 hours
3. Add page identity clarity (Issue #24) — 6 hours
