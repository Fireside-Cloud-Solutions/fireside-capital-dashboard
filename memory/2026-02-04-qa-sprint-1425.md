## New Issues Found
**FC-072:** Investments page missing ACTIONS column (P3 Low)

- Users must use a different method to modify investment accounts
- Estimated fix: < 2 hours

## Browser Automation Notes
Experienced intermittent timeouts with browser control server (20-second timeouts). Resolved by retrying. All screenshots captured successfully after retry.

## Grade: A — Production Ready
All P0/P1 bugs resolved. No critical blockers. One minor issue (FC-072) can be addressed in future sprint.

## Next Session
Continue with Settings page audit, then move to CSS file audit and mobile responsiveness testing.
