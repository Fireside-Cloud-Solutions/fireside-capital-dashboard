- 130+ pages of comprehensive documentation produced
- 50 actionable tasks created with code examples
- Expected impact: +22 Lighthouse points, modern UI, offline-first PWA

**No New Research Priorities:**
- Checked Discord #research, #dashboard, #reports — no new requests
- Checked BACKLOG.md — no new research epics
- Checked STATUS.md — all recent sessions are QA/Dev/UI-UX (implementation focus)

**Implementation Phase:**
- Research is complete; teams can now execute 50 Ready tasks

## Recommendations for Next Sprint (Today 6:01 PM)

**Option 1: Hold (Most Likely)**
- Continue monitoring mode
- Wait for new research priorities from founder
- No active research work needed

**Option 2: New Research Topics**
If founder requests, potential topics:
- Accessibility testing strategies (screen readers, WCAG audits)
- API optimization (GraphQL vs REST, caching strategies)
- Real-time data strategies (WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, polling)
- Mobile-specific patterns (React Native perf, Expo best practices)
- Voice interface research (Siri shortcuts, Google Assistant)
- Predictive analytics (spending forecasts, ML models)

**Option 3: Implementation Support**
- Provide technical guidance to Builder on CSS Architecture (FC-078-083)
- Code review research-based features
- Answer questions about research findings
