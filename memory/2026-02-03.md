# Sprint QA Audit — February 3, 2026

## Session: 8:05 PM - 8:35 PM

### Objective
Systematic QA audit of all HTML, CSS, and JS files. Check for bugs, accessibility issues, and code quality problems.

### Bugs Found & Fixed

#### BUG-QA001: Literal backtick-n escape sequences
- **Severity:** HIGH (Production)
- **Files Affected:** 10 HTML files (assets, bills, budget, debts, friends, income, investments, reports, settings, transactions)
- **Location:** Line ~14 in each file
- **Issue:** PowerShell escape sequence `\`n` was rendered as literal text instead of newline
- **Fix:** Replaced `\`n` with actual newline character
- **Commit:** `4724ba5`
- **Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED

#### BUG-QA002: Duplicate class attributes
- **Severity:** HIGH (HTML validation failure)
- **Files Affected:** 11 HTML files (all except index.html)
- **Count:** 21 instances
- **Issue:** Elements had two `class` attributes instead of one combined attribute
- **Examples:**
  - `<ul class="dropdown-menu dropdown-menu-end" class="dropdown-menu-wide">`
  - `<h4 id="currentMonth" class="mb-0" class="text-no-wrap">`
  - `<i class="bi bi-inbox me-2" class="icon-warning">`
  - `<div class="card" class="card-bg-info">`
- **Impact:** Invalid HTML, potential browser compatibility issues
- **Fix:** Merged duplicate class attributes into single attribute
- **Commit:** `50535fb`
- **Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED

### Audit Coverage

**HTML Files:** 11/11 reviewed
- All pages structurally sound
- Semantic HTML in place
- Skip links present
- ARIA labels consistent

**CSS Files:** 8/8 reviewed
- Design token system comprehensive
- Responsive design extensive
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- No conflicting rules detected

**JavaScript Files:** 23/23 scanned
- Debug logging properly conditional
- Security logging intentional
- No exposed secrets
- Error handling present

### Code Quality Notes

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive accessibility implementation
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Consistent design token system
- Security patches in place
- Performance optimizations (DNS prefetch, lazy loading)

**Future Work:**
- Plaid integration (TODO marker in transactions.js)
- Runtime testing recommended (auth, charts, data ops)

### Commits
- `4724ba5` - Fix: Remove literal backtick-n escape sequences from 10 HTML files
- `50535fb` - Fix: Remove duplicate class attributes from 11 HTML files

### Next Steps
- Audit COMPLETE
- Code quality: production-ready
- Recommended: Runtime/integration testing
