## Status Updates
- Updated `STATUS.md`:
  - Changed "Active Sub-Agents" from 2 timed-out agents to "No active sub-agents"
  - Added "MAJOR MILESTONE" section
  - Moved all verified-complete items to "Known Issues" as resolved
  - Updated "Current Priorities" to show all P0/P1/P2 work done
- Created this daily log

## Key Insights
1. **Sub-agents from yesterday timed out** — Builder agents spawned 2/2 at 8:23 PM never completed
2. **Anti-Loop Rule applied** — After multiple agent failures on CSS centering, I fixed it directly
3. **All documented bugs are resolved** — No remaining P0/P1/P2 work
4. **NEXT_PRIORITIES.md is outdated** — Marks items as "to do" that are already complete

## Recommendations for Tomorrow
1. **Update NEXT_PRIORITIES.md** — Reflect current state (all major work done)
2. **Choose next phase:**
   - Option A: Low-priority polish (debug code, SRI, password policy) — 1-2 days
   - Option B: iOS mobile app planning (React Native + Expo) — 5-6 week project
   - Option C: Advanced automation (email parsing deployment, Discord reports) — 1-2 weeks
3. **Archive completed sub-agent sessions** — Clean up timed-out agents

## Metrics
- **Commits today:** 1 (c4b0758)
- **Files updated:** 2 (styles.css, STATUS.md)
- **Live site verified:** Yes (assets.html, bills.html tested)
- **Priority items verified:** 7 of 7 complete

## Next Actions
Awaiting user directive on next phase:
- Continue with low-priority backlog items?
- Start iOS mobile app?
- Deploy Gmail integration (needs GitHub secrets approval)?
- New feature development?
