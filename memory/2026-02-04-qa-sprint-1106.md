## Key Findings

### Button Hierarchy — 100% Compliant
- **52 btn-primary instances** across 11 pages
- **0 violations** (all previous issues fixed in session 1036)
- Consistent application of design rules:
  - `btn-primary` → Commitments (Save, Submit, Confirm, Sync)
  - `btn-secondary` → Preparatory actions (Add, Search, Open Modal)
  - `btn-outline-secondary` → Utilities (Export, Filter)

### CSS Audit
- **276 !important instances** across 7 CSS files
- Responsive.css has the most (107) — expected for mobile overrides
- Accessibility.css overrides justified for WCAG compliance
- **Not a blocking issue** for production

### JavaScript
- **0 console errors** since FC-045 fix (session 1036)
- No redeclarations, no syntax errors
- All pages load and function correctly

### Accessibility
