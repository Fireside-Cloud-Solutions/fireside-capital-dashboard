**Status:** ✅ RESEARCH SPRINT COMPLETE — All 6 topics done, Azure DevOps seeded with 12 implementation tasks
**Duration:** ~5 minutes
**Agent:** Capital (Researcher) — cron f6500924

## Summary

All 6 research topics were completed in the Feb 16 sessions. This session:
1. Verified Azure DevOps had 0 work items (empty project)
2. Seeded Azure DevOps with 12 prioritized implementation tasks from research findings
3. Posted implementation recommendations with 7 production-ready code examples to #dashboard

## Azure DevOps Work Items Created (12 tasks)

**P1 — High Impact:**
- FC-118: Webpack build system + code splitting (5h)
- FC-118b: Async/defer scripts across 11 HTML files (2h)
- FC-120: Critical CSS extraction (3h)
- FC-121: Cache-Control headers in staticwebapp.config.json (1h)
- FC-169: Empty states with sample data / onboarding (3h)
- FC-167: Bullet charts for goals — replace gauges (2h)
- FC-164: Operational dashboard — 30/60/90 day cash flow (10h)
- FC-029: Income page KPI summary cards (2h)

**P2 — High Value:**
- FC-165: Progressive disclosure (4 key metrics + collapsible) (2h)
- FC-166: Contextual tooltips for financial ratios (1h)
- FC-152: Bootstrap dark theme — data-bs-theme (4h)
- FC-123: Core Web Vitals monitoring + Lighthouse CI (3h)

## Code Examples Posted to Discord

1. Async/defer script loading (FC-118b)
2. Cache-Control headers config (FC-121)
3. Progressive disclosure with <details> (FC-165)
4. Contextual tooltips with Bootstrap Popovers (FC-166)
5. Horizontal bullet charts with Chart.js (FC-167)
6. Bootstrap dark theme toggle + Chart.js sync (FC-152)
7. Income page KPI cards HTML (FC-029)

## Research Sprint Final Status

All 6 topics complete:
- ✅ CSS Architecture — ITCSS-lite already in use
- ✅ Financial Dashboard UI Patterns — storytelling, not data dumps
- ✅ Chart.js Optimization — CSS variable integration
- ✅ Bootstrap Dark Theme — data-bs-theme="dark" built-in
- ✅ PWA Implementation — service worker + offline cache
- ✅ Performance Optimization — Webpack = +30-50 Lighthouse points

Total implementation backlog from research: ~75-100 hours

## Recommended Next Sprint

1. FC-029 (Income KPI cards, 2h) — P1, fills obvious gap
2. FC-121 (Cache headers, 1h) — zero-risk perf win
3. FC-118b (Defer scripts, 2h) — immediate load improvement
4. FC-169 (Empty states + sample data, 3h) — highest UX impact
