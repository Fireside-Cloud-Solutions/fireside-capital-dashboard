## Available Work Assessment

**Small Fixes (< 20 lines):** 0 ❌

All quick wins from previous sessions are complete:
- ✅ REP002 (Export button aria-label)
- ✅ SET003 (Settings save feedback)
- ✅ SET004 (Emergency Fund Goal validation)
- ✅ BUG-UI-001 (Budget table duplicates)
- ✅ BUG-CSS-001 (Notification dropdown)
- ✅ BUG-TX-002 (Transactions header)
- ✅ BUG-DB-001 (Reports query)
- ✅ UI-008 (Auth z-index)

**Next Priority Items (ALL require Builder):**
- **SET002:** Settings empty state (30 min, ~25-30 lines HTML + JS)
- **FC-108:** Service Worker with caching (P1, 3-4h)
- **FC-118:** Webpack build system (P1, 4-5h)
- **FC-119:** Async/defer script loading (P1, 1-2h)

**UI/UX Polish Backlog:** 17 remaining issues (~47.5h, all require Builder)

**Conclusion:** All remaining work requires Builder delegation per AGENTS.md rules (>20 lines, multi-file changes). No small fixes available.

## Azure DevOps Status

**CLI Not Installed:** Cannot query work items  
**Impact:** Using Discord channels and BACKLOG.md as source of truth  
**Recommendation:** `winget install Microsoft.AzureCLI` (P3, non-blocking)

## Conclusion

✅ **PRODUCTION STABLE — NO URGENT WORK**

All quick wins from recent sessions are complete and verified live (REP002, SET003, SET004). Production is completely stable at **A+ grade** with zero P0/P1 issues. All remaining work requires Builder delegation per AGENTS.md rules:

- **SET002** (Settings empty state) — Next quick win, 30 min, requires Builder (~25-30 lines)
- **17 UI/UX polish items** — 47.5 hours total, all require Builder
- **P1 backlog items** — PWA (4-5h), performance (6-7h), all require Builder

**Awaiting founder prioritization** on which implementation phase to begin. Zero blockers, zero urgent bugs, production completely stable.

**Next Action:** Founder must choose implementation priority:
1. UI/UX polish continuation (5-7h)
2. PWA Phase 1 (4-5h)
3. Performance optimization (6-7h)
4. Hold and continue monitoring
