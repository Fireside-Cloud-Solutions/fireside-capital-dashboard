# Memory — 2026-02-01

## Session Summary
First full day of Fireside Capital development. Massive progress but chaotic execution — too much work done by orchestrator directly, sub-agents timing out, context lost between sessions.

## What Was Built Today
- 20+ commits to GitHub, all auto-deployed to Azure
- Security: XSS remediation (2 phases), CSRF, session hardening, rate limiting, pentest
- Responsive: Mobile responsiveness pass, overflow fixes, chart responsiveness
- UX: Tri-color brand system (Blue/Orange/Green), button hierarchy on all 8 pages
- Features: Shared bills, friends page, budget calculation fix, email scanning backend
- Architecture: Full architecture doc, iOS strategy, migration scripts
- New pages: friends.html, polish-demo.html, test-csrf.html

## Known Issues
- Assets page routing broken (CRITICAL) — shows Bills content instead
- Monthly bills total miscalculation ($6,337 vs expected $5,944)
- Shared bill deletion lacks warning dialog
- Dashboard visualizations too small on rows 2-3 (need to push to new rows)
- App needs more polish to match Fireside Cloud Solutions website family feel

## Founder Feedback
- Frustrated with lack of multi-agent execution (agents timing out, Capital doing work itself)
- Wants autonomous operation like Conductor in Fireside HQ
- Wants world-class quality: responsive, accessible, secure, modern, branded
- Plans iOS + Android mobile app (React Native + Expo)
- This is first piece of a personal assistant platform
- Gmail integration for bill parsing is a high priority feature

## Infrastructure Added (by Fireside)
- DIRECTIVE.md — Master operating directive (Conductor-style)
- STATUS.md — Current project state tracker
- This memory file — Daily continuity log
- Updated AGENTS.md with session startup checklist and operating procedures
- Capital switched to Sonnet (faster, higher rate limits for dev work)
- Dual auth profiles (OAuth + API key fallback) to prevent rate limit lockouts

## Evening Session (12:57 EST) — Multi-Agent Execution

### Directive Received
Founder issued new operating files:
- DIRECTIVE.md — Master operating directive (Conductor-style autonomy rules)
- Updated STATUS.md, NEXT_PRIORITIES.md
- Explicit instruction: spawn agents in parallel, no more doing work myself

### Actions Completed
1. ✅ Organized workspace — Moved 80+ files from root into docs/, reports/, scripts/, tests/, audits/
2. ✅ Spawned 3 agents in parallel:
   - Builder-Assets: Fix Assets page routing bug (CRITICAL)
   - Builder-UX: UX/UI polish to match Fireside Cloud Solutions brand
   - Connector-Gmail: Gmail API integration research & implementation plan
3. ✅ Posted status update to #dashboard
4. ✅ Updated STATUS.md with active agents

### Agents Running (as of 12:58 EST)
- builder-fix-assets-routing (20min timeout)
- builder-ux-ui-polish (20min timeout)
- connector-gmail-integration-research (20min timeout)

### Next Actions (When Agents Report Back)
1. Update STATUS.md for each completion
2. Deploy fixes to Azure if needed
3. Verify live site improvements
4. Spawn next priority agents if more work queued
