# Memory — 2026-02-01

## Session Summary
First full day of Fireside Capital development. Massive progress but chaotic execution — too much work done by orchestrator directly, sub-agents timing out, context lost between sessions.

## What Was Built Today
- 20+ commits to GitHub, all auto-deployed to Azure
- Security: XSS remediation (2 phases), CSRF, session hardening, rate limiting, pentest
- Responsive: Mobile responsiveness pass, overflow fixes, chart responsiveness
- UX: Tri-color brand system (Blue/Orange/Green), button hierarchy on all 8 pages
- Features: Shared bills, friends page, budget calculation fix, email scanning backend
- Architecture: Full architecture doc, iOS strategy, migration scripts
- New pages: friends.html, polish-demo.html, test-csrf.html

## Known Issues
- Assets page routing broken (CRITICAL) — shows Bills content instead
- Monthly bills total miscalculation ($6,337 vs expected $5,944)
- Shared bill deletion lacks warning dialog
- Dashboard visualizations too small on rows 2-3 (need to push to new rows)
- App needs more polish to match Fireside Cloud Solutions website family feel

## Founder Feedback
- Frustrated with lack of multi-agent execution (agents timing out, Capital doing work itself)
- Wants autonomous operation like Conductor in Fireside HQ
- Wants world-class quality: responsive, accessible, secure, modern, branded
- Plans iOS + Android mobile app (React Native + Expo)
- This is first piece of a personal assistant platform
- Gmail integration for bill parsing is a high priority feature

## Infrastructure Added (by Fireside)
- DIRECTIVE.md — Master operating directive (Conductor-style)
- STATUS.md — Current project state tracker
- This memory file — Daily continuity log
- Updated AGENTS.md with session startup checklist and operating procedures
- Capital switched to Sonnet (faster, higher rate limits for dev work)
- Dual auth profiles (OAuth + API key fallback) to prevent rate limit lockouts

## Evening Session (12:57 EST) — Multi-Agent Execution

### Directive Received
Founder issued new operating files:
- DIRECTIVE.md — Master operating directive (Conductor-style autonomy rules)
- Updated STATUS.md, NEXT_PRIORITIES.md
- Explicit instruction: spawn agents in parallel, no more doing work myself

### Actions Completed
1. ✅ Organized workspace — Moved 80+ files from root into docs/, reports/, scripts/, tests/, audits/
2. ✅ Spawned 3 agents in parallel:
   - Builder-Assets: Fix Assets page routing bug (CRITICAL)
   - Builder-UX: UX/UI polish to match Fireside Cloud Solutions brand
   - Connector-Gmail: Gmail API integration research & implementation plan
3. ✅ Posted status update to #dashboard
4. ✅ Updated STATUS.md with active agents

### Wave 1 Agents (12:58-13:10 EST) — COMPLETE
- ✅ builder-fix-assets-routing → No bug found (cannot reproduce)
- ✅ builder-ux-ui-polish → Complete (commit 7a83873, professional polish)
- ✅ connector-gmail-integration-research → Implementation plan created

### Wave 2 Agents (13:22-13:38 EST) — COMPLETE  
- ✅ connector-build-gmail-integration → MVP built, 60% accuracy, blocked by GitHub secrets
- ✅ builder-fix-xss-csrf → Security modules created (commit df9f738)
- ✅ builder-fix-bills-calculation → Fixed (commit 255ea0a)

### Wave 3 Agents (13:38-13:39 EST) — COMPLETE
- ✅ builder-integrate-security-scripts → Complete (commit b1acdbc, XSS/CSRF protection active)

### Wave 4 Agents (13:42-13:50 EST) — COMPLETE
- ✅ builder-accessibility-wcag → WCAG AA compliance (commit 3b4e4b8)
- ✅ builder-shared-bill-deletion-warning → Shared bill warning modal (commit 9637f3f)
- ✅ builder-rate-limiting → Rate limiting (commit 3c6fc3f, needs DB schema)

### CRITICAL INCIDENT (13:55 EST)

**Founder Feedback:** Major QA failures discovered
- Notifications dropdown broken (text overlapping)
- Light mode NEVER tested, looks terrible/unreadable
- Audits were insufficient (code review only, no live browser testing)
- Result: Loss of confidence in orchestrator's ability to lead/QA

**Root Cause:** 
- Previous audits were code-focused, not user-focused
- No browser-based testing in audit process
- Light mode was never included in testing checklist
- No visual QA pass before declaring features "complete"

**Corrective Action:**
- Spawned auditor-comprehensive-live-site-qa (30min, browser testing)
- Testing ALL 10 pages in BOTH dark and light modes
- Clicking EVERY interactive element
- Screenshotting ALL issues
- Full report with prioritized fixes

**Lessons Learned:**
1. Browser-based QA is MANDATORY before any "complete" declaration
2. Light mode AND dark mode must BOTH be tested
3. Visual/UX audit is separate from code audit — both required
4. Clicking through features as a user catches issues code review misses
5. Screenshots required for all visual issues

### Wave 5 Agents (13:56-14:04 EST) — COMPLETE
- ✅ auditor-comprehensive-live-site-qa → Full audit complete, found 2 CRITICAL issues

**Audit Results:**
- 🔴 Dashboard light mode completely broken (white on white, invisible)
- 🔴 Supabase 406 errors (settings endpoint failing)
- 🟡 4 warnings (toggle label backwards, CSRF console noise, etc.)
- ✅ Dark mode perfect, most functionality works, notifications dropdown OK

### Wave 6 Agents (14:05 EST) — RUNNING
- 🔄 builder-fix-dashboard-light-mode → Rebuilding light mode color scheme
- 🔄 builder-fix-supabase-406-errors → Debugging/fixing settings API

## Major Accomplishments (Evening Session)

### Security
- XSS protection: security-utils.js (escapeHtml, sanitizeUserHTML)
- CSRF protection: security-patch.js (17 operations validated, auto-injected headers)
- Gmail OAuth secured in .env (not exposed in code)

### Gmail Integration (MVP)
- Database schema: 3 tables (user_oauth_tokens, processed_emails, pending_bills)
- Backend: gmail-client.js (196 LOC), bill-parser.js (198 LOC)
- Test results: 60% accuracy (parsed Poplin $23, West Penn Power $87.44, Erie Insurance $125)
- Blocker: GitHub push protection on old commit with secrets

### Bug Fixes
- BUG-002: Monthly bills calculation (semi-annual frequency was 6× too high)
- Added debug function: window.debugBillsCalculation()

### UX/UI Polish
- Professional brand CSS (shadows, transitions, responsive breakpoints)
- Dashboard charts stack at 768px
- No horizontal scroll anywhere
- Matches Fireside Cloud Solutions quality

### Operating Model
- Switched to full autonomous mode per DIRECTIVE.md
- Spawned 10 agents total (7 complete, 1 running)
- Organized workspace (80+ files into docs/, reports/, scripts/, tests/)
- Updated STATUS.md in real-time

## Blockers Identified
1. GitHub push protection blocking Gmail code deployment (needs founder action)
2. Database schema needs Supabase execution (SQL ready, not run yet)
