## Sprint UI/UX Verification (4:06 AM - 4:30 AM)

Conducted comprehensive verification of Feb 9 UI/UX audit recommendations.

### Verified Fixes ✅
1. **INV-001** (P0): Empty state for investments table — properly implemented with `toggleEmptyState()`
2. **INV-003** (P1): Investment type display names — `getInvestmentTypeDisplayName()` working correctly
3. **INV-008** (P1): Actions column with Edit/Delete buttons — rendering properly
4. **FRD-002** (P1): Search input accessibility label — confirmed at friends.html:143

### Confirmed Open Issues ❌
1. **INV-002** (P0): No loading state on Save Investment button
   - `loading-states.js` utility exists but NOT loaded on investments.html
   - Fix time: 15 minutes
   
2. **INV-006** (P1): Annual return accepts unrealistic values
   - Currently only `min="0"`, needs `min="-20" max="50"`
   - Fix time: 2 minutes
   
3. **INV-005** (P1): Starting Balance still marked as required
   - Should allow $0 starting balance
   - Fix time: 2 minutes

4. **Z-Index Violations**: Found hardcoded `z-index: 1000` and `z-index: 100000` in main.css
   - Design tokens exist but not being used
   - Related to WI-5 (Sidebar Z-Index Conflicts)

### Needs Browser Testing ⚠️
- INV-004: Modal title change (Add vs Edit)
- INV-007: Inline validation feedback
- REP-001/002/003: Reports page empty/loading states
- FRD-001: Friends page empty state

### Actions Taken
1. Created detailed verification report: `reports/sprint-uiux-verification-2026-02-10.md`
2. Posted summary to #dashboard (Discord channel 1467330085949276448)
3. Identified 19 minutes of quick fixes for Builder agent
4. Flagged design system inconsistencies (z-index violations)

### Recommendations
1. Spawn Builder to fix confirmed issues (19 min work)
2. Spawn Auditor for browser testing (30 min work)
3. Install Azure CLI for automated work item tracking
4. Address z-index violations as part of WI-5

### Next Sprint Check
Scheduled: February 10, 2026 @ 4:06 PM EST (12 hours)

### Notes
- Azure CLI not installed, cannot query Azure DevOps programmatically
- All pages use consistent auth state structure
- Empty states system working well where implemented
- Loading states utility exists but underutilized
