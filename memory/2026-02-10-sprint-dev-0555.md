# Sprint Dev Session — Feb 10, 2026, 5:55 AM

**Cron Job:** sprint-dev (a54d89bf-1328-47bf-8cbb-e13ca14d056d)  
**Agent:** Capital (Lead Dev)  
**Duration:** 3 minutes  
**Task:** Check Azure DevOps, scan Discord channels, pick highest priority

---

## What I Did

### 1. Channel Scan
Checked #qa, #ui-ux, #research for bug reports, design issues, and recommendations.

**Findings:**
- **#qa** — All QA complete, CSS z-index cleanup 100% done, production safe
- **#ui-ux** — Debts page audit complete with 39 issues documented (all P2/P3)
- **#research** — All 7 core topics complete, ready for implementation

**Result:** No critical bugs or blockers. All recent fixes deployed.

### 2. Priority Selection
Reviewed research recommendations for highest ROI work:
1. **PWA Manifest** (1h) — Mobile installability ⭐ **SELECTED**
2. Chart.js Performance (2-3h) — 40-60% faster
3. Performance Quick Wins (2h) — 60% faster page loads

**Decision:** PWA Manifest is quickest win with highest user value.

### 3. Sub-Agent Spawn
Spawned Builder (session b2a6be0d) to implement PWA functionality:
- Create manifest.json with app metadata
- Update all 11 HTML pages with manifest links
- Test installation on live site
- Estimated: 1 hour

## Key Metrics

- **Channels scanned:** 3 (#qa, #ui-ux, #research)
- **Bugs found:** 0 (no urgent issues)
- **Sub-agents spawned:** 1 (Builder for PWA)
- **Time to decision:** 3 minutes
- **Implementation:** In progress

## Builder Results

**Completion:** Builder finished successfully despite initial 401 auth error

**Work Completed (Commit 0b24dc0):**
- ✅ manifest.json created
- ✅ All 11 HTML pages updated with PWA meta tags
- ✅ Icon directory created with README
- ✅ 20 files changed (2,138 insertions)

**Deployment Issue Found:**
- Commit 0b24dc0: Deployed successfully
- Commit 5632b12 (updated icon README): Failed — "No matching Static Web App environment"
- manifest.json returns 404 on live site (needs investigation)

**Capital Follow-up:**
1. Verified code changes committed correctly
2. Checked deployment status (latest failed)
3. Attempted browser test (manifest not accessible)
4. Updated STATUS.md with findings
5. Posted warning to #dev

## Context for Next Session

**Current State:**
- Production-ready code (no bugs)
- PWA implementation complete in code
- Azure deployment issue blocking PWA functionality

**Troubleshooting Needed:**
1. Check Azure portal for Static Web App status
2. Re-trigger deployment or investigate environment error
3. Verify manifest.json serves after redeploy
4. Create actual icon files (192x192 & 512x512)

**Next Sprint Dev:** 5:55 PM EST (12 hours)
- Check if Azure deployment issue resolved
- If yes: verify PWA installability
- If no: escalate to founder or try different approach
- Then: Chart.js performance or more UI/UX fixes
