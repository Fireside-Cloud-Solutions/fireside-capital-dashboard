3. ✅ Chart.js Optimization
4. ✅ Bootstrap Dark Theme Toggle
5. ✅ PWA Implementation

- **Backlog Items:** 45 tasks (FC-078 through FC-127)
- **Estimated Effort:** 60-80 hours for full implementation
- **Status:** All items in "Ready" state

**Priority Breakdown:**

- **P2 (Medium):** 26 items, 28-40 hours
- **P3 (Low):** 6 items, 6-8 hours

## Recommendations Made

**Phase 1: Quick Wins (8-10h) — HIGHEST ROI:**
- Service Worker (3-4h)
- Async scripts (1-2h)
- Cache headers (1h)
- Lazy loading (1-2h)
- Chart.js defaults (30min)

**Awaiting Founder Decision:**
1. Which implementation phase to prioritize?
2. Azure DevOps work items: Manual creation vs CLI install vs BACKLOG.md only?
3. Spawn Builder sub-agent for implementation?

---

## Blockers

- ⚠️ Azure CLI not installed (cannot query/create work items programmatically)
- ⏸️ All implementation work requires Builder delegation (all tasks >20 lines per AGENTS.md)

---

## Next Sprint Research (5:50 PM Today)

1. Monitor for new research requests
2. Check if implementation has started
3. Continue supporting implementation phases
4. Check Azure DevOps for work item updates (if CLI installed)
