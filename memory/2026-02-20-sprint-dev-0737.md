**Priority:** P1 Critical

## What Was Done

### FC-A11Y-CHARTS-001: WCAG 2.1 AA Chart Accessibility Fix

**Problem:**
All chart canvas elements across Dashboard + Reports pages were missing `aria-label` attributes, violating WCAG 2.1 AA Success Criteria 1.1.1 (Non-text Content) and 4.1.2 (Name, Role, Value). Screen readers could not announce chart purpose to visually impaired users.

**Solution:**
Added descriptive `aria-label` attributes to all 13 chart canvas elements:

**Dashboard (index.html) — 8 charts:**
1. `#netWorthTimelineChart` — "Chart showing net worth over time as a line graph"
2. `#cashFlowChart` — "Chart showing monthly cash flow as a bar graph"
3. `#netWorthDeltaChart` — "Chart showing monthly net worth change as a bar graph"
4. `#spendingCategoriesChart` — "Chart showing top spending categories as a doughnut chart"
5. `#savingsRateChart` — "Chart showing savings rate over time as a line graph"
6. `#investmentGrowthChart` — "Chart showing investment growth over time as a line graph"
7. `#assetAllocationChart` — "Chart showing asset allocation as a pie chart"
8. `#dtiGaugeChart` — "Chart showing debt-to-income ratio as a gauge chart"

**Reports (reports.html) — 5 charts:**
1. `#netWorthTimelineChart` — "Chart showing net worth over time as a line graph"
2. `#monthlyCashFlowChart` — "Chart showing monthly cash flow as a bar graph"
3. `#spendingCategoriesChart` — "Chart showing top spending categories as a doughnut chart"
4. `#savingsRateChart` — "Chart showing savings rate over time as a line graph"
5. `#investmentGrowthChart` — "Chart showing investment growth over time as a line graph"

**Files Changed:**
- `app/index.html` — 8 lines (canvas elements)
- `app/reports.html` — 5 lines (canvas elements)
- `BACKLOG.md` — 2 lines (marked Done)

**Commits:**
- `f3a101f` — FC-A11Y-CHARTS-001: Add aria-label to all 13 chart canvas elements
- `b464d46` — Update BACKLOG: Mark completed

## Lessons Learned

- Simple systematic fixes (adding attributes) can have massive accessibility impact
- WCAG compliance checks should be part of component creation templates
- aria-label should be added to all canvas elements at creation time, not as a fix later
