## Remaining Research Topics

- Financial dashboard UI patterns (competitor analysis)
- Bootstrap dark theme customization
- Performance optimization strategies

## Issues Encountered

- Azure DevOps API requires authentication (az CLI not installed)
- Cannot create work items programmatically at this time
- Workaround: Posted findings to Discord #reports channel

## Recommendations

1. Start with TASK-001 (CSS architecture) as foundation
2. Spawn Builder agent when ready to implement
3. Consider manual Azure DevOps work item creation
4. Continue research on remaining topics

## Next Actions

- Monitor for Azure DevOps access setup
- Continue research backlog
- Ready to spawn Builder for implementation when directed
