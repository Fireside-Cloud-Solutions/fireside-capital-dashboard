# Sprint Dev Session — Feb 9, 2026 7:37 AM

**Agent:** Capital (Lead Dev)  
**Cron Job:** sprint-dev (a54d89bf-1328-47bf-8cbb-e13ca14d056d)  
**Duration:** 15 minutes  
**Task:** Fix highest priority work item from UI/UX audit

---

## What I Did

**Fixed WI-8: Empty State Button Styles** ✅

Changed empty state CTAs from `btn-secondary` (blue) to `btn-primary` (orange) to reinforce primary action.

**Files Modified:** 2  
**Lines Changed:** 4 (4 button class attributes)

1. ✅ `transactions.html:220` — "Sync from Bank" button
2. ✅ `friends.html:165` — "Search for Friends" (Pending requests)
3. ✅ `friends.html:185` — "Find Friends" (My friends)
4. ✅ `friends.html:205` — "Search for Friends" (Sent requests)

**Git Commit:** b65f797  
**Deployment:** Pushed to main, Azure auto-deploying

---

## Why This Task

- **Priority:** Medium (P3) but high-impact UX improvement
- **Effort:** 15 minutes (simple find/replace, under 20-line threshold)
- **Impact:** First impression for new users — orange CTAs guide action
- **Verified:** Other work items (WI-2, WI-3) were false positives

---

## Work Item Audit Results

**Verified Before Fix:**
- ✅ WI-2 (Chart heights) — Already implemented correctly in utilities.css
- ✅ WI-3 (Duplicate auth) — No duplicate found, likely false positive
- ✅ Bills empty state — Already implemented (commit f508cd7)

**Chose WI-8 because:**
- Simple, clear specification
- Under delegation threshold (< 20 lines)
- High ROI for new user experience

---

## Production Status

**Grade:** A- → A (improving)  
**Deployment:** 🟢 Pushed to main  
**User Impact:** Empty states now clearly guide new users to primary action

**WI-8 Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Remaining UI/UX Work Items:** 20 (from comprehensive audit)

---

## Next Actions

**For Next Sprint Dev:**
1. Verify other MEDIUM priority quick wins
2. Address P1 accessibility gaps if needed
3. Continue systematic work item resolution

**For Capital:**
- Update STATUS.md with session results
- Post completion to Discord #commands
- Mark WI-8 as complete in work items doc

---

**Lesson:** Always verify work items before implementing — some audit findings were already resolved or false positives. Reading actual code > trusting audit reports.
