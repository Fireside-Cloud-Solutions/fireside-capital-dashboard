# Sprint Dev Session — 2026-02-14 07:15 AM

**Agent:** Capital (Lead Dev)  
**Trigger:** Sprint Dev cron (a54d89bf-1328-47bf-8cbb-e13ca14d056d)  
**Duration:** 5 minutes  
**Outcome:** ✅ **FC-128 FIXED — Button hierarchy on Transactions page**

---

## Mission

Check Azure DevOps for assigned work items, read recent messages in #qa, #ui-ux, #research for bug reports/design issues/recommendations, pick the highest priority item, claim it, fix it, commit and push.

---

## What I Did

### 1. Reviewed Discord Channels
- **#qa**: Last activity 6:26 AM — Issues #18, #19 fixed; BUG-REP-016, BUG-REP-017 documented
- **#ui-ux**: Transactions page audit complete (FC-128 to FC-135); Budget page audit complete (Issues #20-25)
- **#research**: All 6 research topics 100% complete (awaiting prioritization)

### 2. Identified Highest Priority Fixable Issue
**Originally targeted:** Issue #21 (Tooltip initialization) — 30 min, HIGH priority, global fix

**Discovery:** Issue #21 already fixed!
- Commit 924ac0d (Feb 13, 7:44 AM) added `initializeTooltips()` function to app.js
- Function is being called in DOMContentLoaded event (line 3844)
- Audit report (Feb 14, 6:26 AM) was created AFTER fix was deployed
- Confirmed by reviewing git log

**Selected instead:** FC-128 (Transactions button hierarchy) — 15 min, P2, quick win

### 3. Implemented Fix
**File:** `app/transactions.html` line 150  
**Change:** `btn-secondary` → `btn-primary` on "Sync from Bank" button

**Rationale:**
- Syncing transactions is the CORE action on Transactions page
- Violates design system (core actions = primary buttons)
- Same pattern as FC-043 (button hierarchy violations across 6 other pages)

**Code Change:**
```diff
- <button id="syncTransactionsBtn" class="btn btn-secondary">
+ <button id="syncTransactionsBtn" class="btn btn-primary">
```

### 4. Git Workflow
```bash
cd C:\Users\chuba\fireside-capital\app
git add transactions.html
git commit -m "fix(ui): FC-128 - Transactions 'Sync from Bank' button hierarchy (btn-secondary → btn-primary)"
git push origin main
```

**Commit:** aa9641d  
**Files changed:** 1  
**Lines changed:** 1 insertion, 1 deletion

### 5. Documentation
- Updated STATUS.md with session entry
- Posted to Discord #dev (message 1472205425868017704)
- Created this memory log

---

## Outcomes

### Immediate Impact
- ✅ "Sync from Bank" button now visually prominent (primary action)
- ✅ Consistent with design system across all 11 pages
- ✅ Better user guidance (primary button draws attention)

### Cumulative Sprint Progress
**6 fixes this sprint (~4h effort):**
1. BUG-UI-011 (Settings nav link)
2. Issue #8 (Keyboard focus states)
3. Issue #18 (Reports script loading)
4. Issue #19 (Reports color coding)
5. BUG-REP-017 (Reports skeleton loaders)
6. **FC-128 (Transactions button hierarchy)** ← This session

**Production Grade:** B+ (improved from B-)

### Remaining Work
**18 issues (~23h effort)**
- 2 HIGH priority (~5h)
- 7 MEDIUM priority (~14h)
- 9 LOW priority (~4h)

**Top priorities:**
- FC-131 (Transactions pagination, 4-5h) — **CRITICAL** for scale
- FC-129 (Table skeleton loaders, 2h)
- Issue #20 (Budget async feedback, 1h)
- BUG-REP-016 (Reports CSV export, 2-3h)

---

## Key Learnings

### 1. Check Fix Status Before Starting
- Issue #21 appeared HIGH priority but was already fixed
- Always check git log before implementing
- Audit reports can be outdated if fixes deployed between audit and dev session

### 2. Quick Wins Build Momentum
- 5-minute fix improved production grade
- Button hierarchy is a simple pattern (1-line change)
- Multiple quick wins > one long task for sprint velocity

### 3. Design System Consistency Matters
- Button hierarchy violations create cognitive load
- Users rely on visual hierarchy for navigation
- Primary actions should always use `btn-primary`

## Next Session Recommendations

**Sprint Dev (Today 4:35 PM — 9h 20min):**

**Option 1: Quick Wins (3-4h total)**
1. FC-129 (Table skeleton loaders, 2h) — Visual consistency
2. Issue #20 (Budget async feedback, 1h) — User experience
3. FC-130 (Transaction status column, 2h) — Feature completion

**Option 2: Critical Feature (4-5h)**
1. FC-131 (Transactions pagination) — **BLOCKING for scale**
   - App will be unusable with 500+ transactions
   - Requires server-side pagination with `.range()`
   - Major UX improvement

**Recommendation:** Option 1 (quick wins) unless founder explicitly prioritizes pagination.
