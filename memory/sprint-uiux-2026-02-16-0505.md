**Finding:** 151 items tracked (73% done, 26% ready, 1% in progress)

---

## Remaining Work (All Require Delegation)

Per AGENTS.md: *"Small fixes < 20 lines → DO IT YOURSELF. Medium/Large → DELEGATE."*

All remaining bugs exceed the 20-line threshold:

**P2 MEDIUM (1 item, 2-3h):**
- BUG-JS-001 — Remove 151 console.log statements across JS files

**P3 LOW (2 items, 9-20h):**
- BUG-PERF-003 — Bundle 15-20 script tags (requires build system, 45 min)
- BUG-CSS-001 — Clean up 303 !important instances across 12 CSS files (8-12h)

**Total Remaining:** ~11-16 hours (all require Builder delegation)

**Research Implementation (10 items, 31-43h):**
- FC-142 to FC-151 — CSS architecture (ITCSS + BEM), dashboard redesign, performance optimizations
- Requires founder approval for architectural changes

**Total Remaining (Including Research):** ~42-59 hours

## Recommendations

### Next Sprint UI/UX (Today 5:05 PM — 12 hours)

**Option 1: HOLD (Monitoring Mode) — RECOMMENDED**
- All systematic reviews complete (11/11 pages, 12/12 CSS files)
- All P0/P1 bugs resolved
- All quick wins (< 20 lines) complete
- Wait for founder priorities OR new bug reports

**Option 2: Delegate Console Cleanup**
- Spawn Builder for BUG-JS-001 (2-3h)
- Professional production code quality
- Security improvement (no data exposure in logs)

**Option 3: Delegate Script Bundling**
- Spawn Builder for BUG-PERF-003 (45 min)
- Quick performance win
- Reduce bundle size

**Option 4: Research Implementation**
- Begin FC-142 to FC-151 (CSS architecture, performance optimizations)
- Requires founder approval
- Total effort: 31-43 hours
