**Session ID:** ad7d7355-8e6a-48fc-a006-4076a2937f6f  
**Agent:** Capital (Sprint UI/UX cron)  
**Duration:** ~15 minutes  
**Task:** Continue UI/UX audit, check Azure DevOps, review next page

---

## Mission

Check Azure DevOps for design work items → Audit next unaudited page → Post findings to #dashboard → Create work items for issues found

---

## Execution

### 1. Status Check
- Read STATUS.md — Recent activity: Sprint QA verified INV fixes, Sprint Dev fixed REP-004, Sprint Research complete
- Azure DevOps: CLI not installed (known issue)
- 21 UI/UX work items already documented in `reports/ui-ux-audit-workitems-2026-02-09.md`

### 2. Page Selection
**Pages audited:** Dashboard, Bills, Transactions, Investments, Reports, Friends, Settings  
**Pages remaining:** Assets, Budget, Debts, Income

**Selected:** Assets page (core financial page, not recently audited)

### 3. Assets Page Audit
**Reviewed:**
- assets.html (complete HTML structure)
- app.js (renderAssets, saveAsset, openAssetModal, deleteAsset functions)
- main.css (design system, button styles, card styles)

**Findings:** 6 issues total
- 1 P0 (Critical): No loading state on Save Asset button
- 1 P1 (High): Asset type mismatch (`real-estate` vs `realEstate`)
- 2 P2 (Medium): No validation, no inline feedback
- 2 P3 (Polish): Button hierarchy, "Other" type incomplete

**Strengths Found:**
- Empty state system ✅
- Modal title changes ✅
- Type display names ✅
- Actions column ARIA labels ✅
- CSRF + rate limiting ✅
- Delete confirmation ✅

## Key Findings

### ASS-001 (P0): No Loading State on Save Button
**Impact:** User can double-click and submit twice  
**Root Cause:** `loading-states.js` not loaded on assets.html  
**Fix Time:** 15 minutes  
**Similar Issues:** Investments page has same problem (already documented as INV-002)

### ASS-002 (P1): Real Estate Type Mismatch
**Impact:** Edit modal won't populate fields for real estate assets  
**Root Cause:** HTML uses `real-estate` (kebab-case), JS checks for `realEstate` (camelCase)  
**Fix Time:** 5 minutes  
**Pattern:** Other pages use consistent casing, only Assets has this issue

### Design System Compliance
**Button Hierarchy:** "Add Asset" uses secondary blue, should be primary orange (tri-color rule: 1 primary/page)  
**Consistency:** Same pattern as Investments, Reports — most pages use secondary for primary actions

---

## Observations

### Pattern: Systematic Loading State Gap
- Assets: ❌ No loading state
- Investments: ❌ No loading state (documented as INV-002)
- Bills: ✅ Has loading state
- Transactions: N/A (no save operation)

**Conclusion:** Loading states were added to some pages but not systematically. Needs comprehensive fix across all CRUD modals.

### Pattern: Type Display Name Functions
- Assets: ✅ Has `getAssetTypeDisplayName()`
- Investments: ✅ Has `getInvestmentTypeDisplayName()`
- Bills: N/A
- Debts: Unknown (not audited yet)

**Conclusion:** Type display name pattern is working well where implemented.

## Azure DevOps Status

**Azure CLI:** Not installed (known limitation)  
**Work Items:** 21 existing from previous audit in `reports/ui-ux-audit-workitems-2026-02-09.md`  
**Action:** Manual creation of ASS-001 through ASS-006 recommended

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (This Session)
1. ✅ Assets audit complete
2. ✅ Report written
3. ✅ Discord posted
4. ⏳ Update STATUS.md

### Next Sprint Check (4:47 PM EST)
1. Audit next page: Budget, Debts, or Income
2. Check if ASS-001/ASS-002 were fixed
3. Continue systematic page-by-page audit

### Long-Term
1. **Systematic Loading State Fix:** Create Builder task to add loading states to ALL CRUD modals (Assets, Investments, Debts, Bills, Income, Budget)
2. **Validation Framework:** Create standard validation pattern, apply to all forms
3. **Button Hierarchy Audit:** Review ALL pages for tri-color hierarchy compliance

---

## Production Impact

**Grade:** A- (Production quality with minor issues)  
**Deployment Status:** 🟢 No blockers  
**User Impact:** ASS-001 (P0) allows double-submission, recommend fix before heavy usage
