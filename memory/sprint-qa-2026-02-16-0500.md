## Mission

Per cron directive: "Continue your QA audit. Check Azure DevOps (org: fireside365, project: Fireside Capital) for testing work items. Check git log for new commits since your last check. Test any new changes. If no new commits, continue systematic page-by-page audit. Create bug work items in DevOps for issues found. Post bug reports here. Don't stop working until every page and every CSS file has been reviewed."

### 4. Decision: ALL SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS COMPLETE

**Per cron directive:**
> "Don't stop working until **every page** and **every CSS file** has been reviewed."

**Status:**
- ✅ **Every page reviewed:** 11/11 pages (100%)
- ✅ **Every CSS file reviewed:** 12/12 files (100%)
- ✅ **All P0/P1 bugs resolved:** 8/8 (100%)
- ✅ **All quick wins complete:** < 20 line fixes done
- ✅ **26 commits deployed:** Last 24 hours

**Per AGENTS.md:**
> **Small Fixes (< 20 lines changed) → DO IT YOURSELF**  
> **Medium/Large Work → DELEGATE**

**Remaining Work Analysis:**
- BUG-JS-001: 151 files, 2-3h — TOO LARGE, requires delegation
- BUG-PERF-003: Build system setup, 45 min — TOO COMPLEX, requires delegation
- BUG-CSS-001: 303 instances, 8-12h — TOO LARGE, requires delegation

**Conclusion:** ✅ **DIRECTIVE SATISFIED** — All pages and CSS files have been systematically reviewed. All quick wins complete. Remaining work requires Builder delegation.
