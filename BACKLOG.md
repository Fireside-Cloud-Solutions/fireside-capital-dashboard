Users may double-click causing duplicate API calls. ✅ FIXED commit 9d7ca92 (2026-02-21 Sprint Dev 0507) - Button now disabled during save, shows inline spinner, re-enables after both saveSettings() and saveCategoryBudgets() complete.

Affected: Assets, Bills, Budget, Dashboard, Debts, Friends, Income, Investments, Operations, Reports, Transactions (Settings FIXED commit ac37738). ✅ FIXED commit d18d149 (2026-02-21 Sprint Dev 0507) - Updated main.css to support both h1/h2, changed all 11 page titles to h1 tags.

| BUG-UIUX-MODAL-FORM-SPACING-001 | Bug | P2 | S | Ready | **All modal forms use mb-3 for label-to-input (should be mb-1 for better grouping)** - Modal form fields use Bootstrap default mb-3 (16px) for all spacing. Labels-to-inputs should be tighter (4px) for better visual grouping (Gestalt proximity principle). Affects 10+ pages (all modals). Global find/replace label form-label → label form-label mb-1. (2h) - Sprint QA 0513, 2026-02-21 - see reports/sprint-qa-0513-audit-report.md |
| BUG-UIUX-OPS-TOGGLE-CONTRAST-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **Operations cash flow toggle active state lacks contrast in dark mode** - Active state for cash flow toggle buttons (operations.html line ~113) uses Bootstrap default .active class, lacks sufficient contrast in dark mode.

(20 min) - Sprint QA 0513, 2026-02-21 - see reports/sprint-qa-0513-audit-report.md |
| BUG-UIUX-TRANS-PAGINATION-DOCS-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **Pagination controls use d-none with no explanation** - Pagination controls (transactions.html line ~245) use d-none by default (correct — hidden until transactions load), but logic isn't documented. Add HTML comment + data-state attribute. (10 min) - Sprint QA 0513, 2026-02-21 - see reports/sprint-qa-0513-audit-report.md |

| BUG-UX-ALERT-001 | Bug | P2 | S | Ready | **63 native alert() calls across 7 JS files** - app.js�49, onboarding.js�5, plaid.js�2, subscriptions.js�2, charts.js�1, email-bills.js�1, reports.js�1, security-patch.js�1. Toast system exists but native window.alert override is commented out. Blocking dialogs break UX + mobile. Fix: uncomment override (5 min quick win) + replace each with correct Toast type (2-3h proper fix). (Sprint UI/UX 0445, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-UX-CONFIRM-001 | Bug | P2 | S | Done | **6 native confirm() blocking dialogs** - FIXED commit e3c78c5 (2026-02-17).

All 12 pages confirmed to have `data-bs-theme="dark"` on `<html>` element (verified Sprint Dev 0715, 2026-02-19). Bootstrap dark mode CSS variables ARE activating. `data-theme="dark"` on `<body>` remains as secondary custom CSS hook. |
| FC-177 | Chore | P3 | XS | Done | **Parallel chart rendering** - FIXED commit 822b393 (2026-02-19). renderChartsParallel(renderers) in chart-factory.js runs any set of async chart renderers via Promise.all() for ~5x faster batch rendering. (Sprint Dev 0735, 2026-02-19) |
| FC-178 | Chore | P3 | XS | Done | **Chart.js tick rotation optimization** - FIXED commit 822b393 (2026-02-19). _applyFixedRotation() in createOptimizedChart() factory sets minRotation: 0, maxRotation: 0, sampleSize: 10 on all x-axes automatically - no manual per-chart changes needed. (Sprint Dev 0735, 2026-02-19) |
| FC-179 | Chore | P3 | XS | Done | **Script defer + Supabase preconnect** - FIXED commit e3c78c5 (2026-02-17). Added preconnect + dns-prefetch for Supabase to all 11 HTML pages. (Sprint Dev 0515, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-CSS-THEME-MIGRATION-INCOMPLETE-001 | Bug | P2 | S | Ready | **Theme system migration incomplete** - FC-102 (commit 1fd857c) migrated from custom `body[data-theme]` to Bootstrap 5.3's `[data-bs-theme]` but left 136 old selectors in place. main.css: 99 occurrences, components.css: 31, accessibility.css: 6. Light mode toggle won't work - HTML uses `data-bs-theme` but CSS still looks for `data-theme`. Fix: search/replace all instances `body[data-theme='light']` ? `[data-bs-theme="light"]` + remove redundant 59 dual selectors added in 1fd857c. Test theme toggle thoroughly. Est: 2-3h.

| BUG-CSS-VERSION-001 | Bug | P2 | XS | Done | **CSS version strings stale on all 11 pages** - FIXED commit c13374b (2026-02-17). main.css, components.css, responsive.css, utilities.css had v=20260203 (Feb 3 date) despite being modified multiple times today Feb 17. onboarding.css had NO version string. Browsers with cached Feb 3 versions wouldn't pick up today's sprint changes. Fixed: all 9 CSS files now v=20260217 on all 11 HTML pages. (Sprint QA 0520, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-MODAL-INSTANCE-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Done | **showConfirmModal() creates new Modal instance on every call** - FIXED commit c13374b (2026-02-17). toast-notifications.js L379: `new bootstrap.Modal()` ? `bootstrap.Modal.getOrCreateInstance()`. Previous code would create duplicate instances on a reused modal element (lazy-injected singleton), triggering Bootstrap "Modal is already shown" warning. (Sprint QA 0520, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-CSS-DUPE-001 | Bug | P3 | S | Ready | **Duplicate .empty-state{} blocks across multiple CSS files** - 4 standalone conflicting blocks: main.css L883 (padding:64px), main.css L2394 (padding:var, max-width:600px, animation), main.css L2829 (padding:4rem=64px, max-width:500px), components.css L1265 (padding:80px = WINS, loaded last). Also: duplicate @keyframes fadeIn at main.css L2440+L2799, duplicate @keyframes fadeInUp at main.css L2379+L3510.

| FC-181 | Feature | P1 | S | Ready | **Budget vs Actuals Engine** - Build `budget-actuals.js` with `calculateBudgetVsActuals(month)`.

| FC-182 | Feature | P1 | S | Done | **Budget vs Actuals UI Card** - FIXED commit 88494b9 (2026-02-17). Added #bvaSection / #bvaCardBody to budget.html, wired renderBudgetVsActuals() call in loadAndRenderBudget(). Syncs with month selector.

| FC-183 | Feature | P2 | S | Ready | **Historical Budget Comparison** - Month-over-month variance trend table (last 6 months per category): which categories consistently over/under budget. Simple table view, no chart needed initially. (1h) - Sprint Research 2026-02-17 |
| FC-184 | Feature | P1 | S | Ready | **Demo Data Module** - Build `demo-data.js` with realistic sample data for all 6 tables (assets, income, bills, debts, investments, transactions, snapshots). Data reflects young professional profile (salary + freelance income, mortgage, car loan, realistic spending). Dynamic transaction/snapshot generation. (3h) - Sprint Research 2026-02-17 - see reports/budget-vs-actuals-sample-data-research-2026-02-17.md |
| FC-185 | Feature | P1 | S | Done | **Data Layer Wrapper for Demo Mode** - FIXED commit e2bbb13 (2026-02-18). `data-layer.js` created with 9 methods (getAssets/Income/Bills/Debts/Investments/Transactions/Snapshots/Settings + upsertSettings). Script tag added to all 12 HTML pages. `budget-actuals.js` refactored to use DataLayer. (Sprint Dev 0635, 2026-02-18) |
| FC-186 | Feature | P2 | XS | Ready | **Demo Mode Banner + Empty State Toggle** - Show sticky "Preview Mode" info banner when demo is active. Add "Preview with Sample Data" button to all empty states. Toggle disables demo on click. (1h) - Sprint Research 2026-02-17 |

| BUG-TOAST-DUPLICATE-001 | Bug | P2 | S | Ready | **Duplicate toast systems coexist** - `Toast` (toast-notifications.js) and `ToastManager` (polish-utilities.js) are two separate implementations of the same UI pattern. `app-polish-enhancements.js` uses `ToastManager`; the rest of the app uses `Toast`. Creates UX inconsistency (different positioning/animation/styling). Fix: make `ToastManager` a thin wrapper delegating to `Toast`, or migrate all callers to `Toast`. Est: 2h. (Sprint QA 0600, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-CATEGORIZER-GUARD-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Done | **categorizer.js calls `sb.auth.getUser()` without guard** - FIXED commit dc8dd1c (2026-02-17). Added `if (typeof sb === 'undefined') return null;` guard at top of checkLearnedPattern(). (Sprint Dev 0639, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-CATEGORIZER-TABLE-001 | Bug | P2 | XS | Ready | **`transaction_category_patterns` table not in documented schema** - categorizer.js queries a `transaction_category_patterns` table with columns `merchant_pattern`, `confidence`, `times_used`, `last_used`. Table is NOT listed in AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, or any migration file. Either undocumented or doesn't exist - categorizer silently returns `null` for every merchant. Fix: verify table exists in Supabase, add to documentation, or create migration. Est: 30 min. (Sprint QA 0600, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-CSRF-DUPLICATE-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **Duplicate CSRF token management** - `security-utils.js` and `csrf.js` both implement CSRF token init/storage using the same `sessionStorage['csrfToken']` key with different initialization sequences. `SecurityUtils.getCSRFToken()` and `CSRF.getToken()` both read the same value. Creates maintenance confusion. Fix: deprecate CSRF functions in security-utils.js, use `CSRF` module exclusively. Est: 30 min. (Sprint QA 0600, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-CHARTTHEME-DEADCODE-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Done | **chart-theme.js dead animation config** - `Chart.defaults.animation.duration = 400` and `.easing` were set AFTER `Chart.defaults.animation = false`, making them no-ops (can't set properties on `false`). Also the `prefers-reduced-motion` check was redundant (animation was already false). FIXED: removed dead lines, clarified comment, kept only definitive `animation = false` + reduced-motion override. Est: 5 min. (Sprint QA 0600, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-DEMO-BILLS-SCHEMA-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **DEMO_BILLS missing `nextDueDate` field** - `renderBills()` in app.js uses `bill.nextDueDate` for the "Next Due" column, but `DEMO_BILLS` in demo-data.js only has `due_day` (integer). When FC-185 data-layer.js routes demo data through the app, bills will show `-` for every due date. Fix: compute `nextDueDate` string from `due_day` in DEMO_BILLS during FC-185 implementation or precompute in demo-data.js. Est: 15 min. (Sprint QA 0600, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-SESSIONSEC-INLINE-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Done | **session-security.js uses inline onclick in dynamic HTML** - FIXED commit fc1eecc (2026-02-18). Changed `onclick="sessionSecurity.hideSessionWarning()"` to `data-action="dismiss-session-warning"` + event delegation. Also fixed BUG-POLISH-DBLINT-001 pt2: `startSessionMonitoring()` was double-firing on page load (getSession + onAuthStateChange(SIGNED_IN) both called it); added `if (this.isActive) return;` guard. (Sprint QA 0641, 2026-02-18) |
| BUG-TRANS-INLINE-001 | Bug | P2 | XS | Done | **transactions.js category select uses inline onchange handler** - FIXED commit 7e0f9b3 (2026-02-18). Changed to `data-transaction-id` attribute + event delegation on `#transactionsTableBody` for `change` events. Persists across re-renders from filter/pagination. (Sprint QA 0641, 2026-02-18) |
| BUG-CACHE-IMMUTABLE-001 | Bug | P1 | XS | Done | **staticwebapp.config.json set JS/CSS to max-age=31536000 immutable but files use static names (no content hash)** - FIXED commit ac4a2f2 (2026-02-18). With immutable caching and non-hashed filenames, deployed JS/CSS updates would be invisible to users for 1 year. Fixed: JS/CSS changed to max-age=86400 must-revalidate (1 day); images/icons 7 days; immutable only appropriate after FC-185 (Webpack content-hash build). (Sprint QA 0641, 2026-02-18) |
| BUG-SECURITY-INLINE-002 | Bug | P3 | XS | Done | **session-security.js showLogoutMessage() uses additional inline onclick** - FIXED commit e6d65b9 (2026-02-18). Changed `onclick="location.reload()"` to `data-action="reload-page"` + event delegation listener at EOF. (Sprint Dev 0635, 2026-02-18) |
| BUG-SECURITY-MODAL-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Done | **session-security.js showLogoutMessage() uses new bootstrap.Modal() instead of getOrCreateInstance()** - FIXED commit e6d65b9 (2026-02-18). 1-line change. (Sprint Dev 0635, 2026-02-18) |
| BUG-POLISH-DBLINT-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Done | **app-polish-enhancements.js double-initializes on every page** - FIXED commit e6d65b9 (2026-02-18). Removed `setTimeout(initializePolishEnhancements, 1000)` re-invocation. Deferred execution is sufficient. (Sprint Dev 0635, 2026-02-18) |
| BUG-UIUX-BVA-CAT-001 | Bug | P2 | XS | Ready | **Budget Item modal category is free-text input - won't match BVA_CATEGORIES enum** - `addBudgetItemModal` uses `<input type="text" id="budgetItemCategory">` but `renderBudgetVsActuals()` maps spending against a fixed 9-item enum in `BVA_CATEGORIES` (dining, groceries, transportation, utilities, entertainment, shopping, healthcare, travel, other). If a user types "Dining Out" instead of "dining", their spending will never show in the BvA card. Fix: replace the `<input>` with a `<select>` dropdown populated from `BVA_CATEGORIES`. Est: 15 min.

| BUG-UIUX-DEMO-STYLE-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **Demo banner uses 7 inline styles across all 11 pages** - `#demoBanner` div has `style="border-radius: 0; margin: 0; position: sticky; top: 0; z-index: 1060; border-left: none; border-right: none; border-top: none;"` - same inline style pattern already flagged in other CSP/maintainability bugs. Fix: create `.demo-banner` CSS class in main.css or components.css, remove inline styles from all 11 HTML pages. Est: 20 min. (Sprint UI/UX 0650, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-UIUX-BVA-SKEL-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **BvA card body (#bvaCardBody) has no initial skeleton state** - In budget.html, `#bvaCardBody` is empty on page load. The JS spinner injected by `renderBudgetVsActuals()` appears AFTER the card header is already visible, causing an inconsistent loading experience (header shows instantly, body lags). Fix: add 3 skeleton progress-bar rows as initial static HTML inside `#bvaCardBody`, matching the pattern used in the budget assignment table. Est: 15 min. (Sprint UI/UX 0650, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-UIUX-MODAL-CANCEL-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **Add Budget Item modal footer missing Cancel button** - `#addBudgetItemModal` footer contains only the "Add Item" `btn-primary` button. No Cancel/Close button in the footer. Users must click X in the header or press Escape to dismiss. Fix: add `<button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-secondary" data-bs-dismiss="modal">Cancel</button>` before "Add Item". Est: 2 min. (Sprint UI/UX 0650, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-RATELIMIT-CROSS-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Done | **rate-limit-db.js calls disableButtonTemporarily() without typeof guard** - FIXED commit e6d65b9 (2026-02-18).

| BUG-TRANS-MODAL-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Done | **addManualTransaction() uses Modal.getInstance() - can null-throw** - FIXED commit dc8dd1c (2026-02-17). Changed to getOrCreateInstance() in transactions.js L335. (Sprint Dev 0639, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-CATEGORIZER-DUP-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **CATEGORIES constant duplicated across transactions.js and categorizer.js** - `transactions.js` defines 11 categories (missing 'uncategorized'); `categorizer.js` defines 12 (includes 'uncategorized'). If one list is updated, the dropdown and the AI categorizer diverge silently. Fix: extract to a single shared `window.TRANSACTION_CATEGORIES` in categorizer.js, remove the duplicate from transactions.js. Est: 20 min. (Sprint UI/UX 0631, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-CATEGORIZER-DELAY-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **categorizeTransactionsBatch() artificial 100ms delay with no progress feedback** - The batch loop has `await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100))` between each transaction to avoid rate limiting. With 35 demo transactions that's 3.5+ seconds of silent processing. No toast or progress indicator shown. Fix: remove or reduce the delay (the Supabase read is already async, throttle is unnecessary for pattern reads), and add a progress toast during batch import. Est: 30 min.

| BUG-LAZY-REGISTRY-001 | Chore | P3 | XS | Ready | **LazyLoader registry missing demo-data.js, budget-actuals.js, onboarding.js** - `lazy-loader.js` has full infrastructure for on-demand script loading (Chart.js, Plaid Link) but `demo-data.js` and `budget-actuals.js` are loaded via `<script>` tags on ALL 11 pages even though they're only needed conditionally. Onboarding.js is always loaded even for returning users. Registering these in LazyLoader would save ~40-60KB of parse time on non-demo, non-onboarding sessions. Est: 1h. (Sprint UI/UX 0631, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-UIUX-ICONS-001 | Bug | P3 | S | Ready | **empty-states.js uses Heroicons SVG inline icons** - All 11 dynamic empty states inject raw SVG from Heroicons. Rest of app uses Bootstrap Icons (bi-* classes). Inconsistent icon system creates visual inconsistency and code bloat. Fix: replace SVG strings with `<i class="bi bi-*">` equivalents. Est: 2h. (Sprint UI/UX 0528, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-UIUX-EMPTYSTATE-CSP-001 | Bug | P3 | S | Ready | **generateEmptyStateHTML() uses inline onclick** - empty-states.js L~120 injects `onclick="handleEmptyStateAction()"` in generated HTML - violates CSP pattern.

| BUG-NOTIF-STYLE-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **notification-enhancements.js uses inline color styles** - `showToastNotification()` uses template literal `style="color: ${color}"` instead of CSS classes. Fix: map color values to CSS utility classes. Est: 30 min. (Sprint UI/UX 0528, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-TOUR-INLINE-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Done | **tour.js `createTooltip()` uses inline onclick** - FIXED commit 431c518 (2026-02-19). Replaced `onclick="skipTour()"` + `onclick="finishTour()/nextTourStop()"` with `data-action="skip-tour"` / `"finish-tour"` / `"next-tour-stop"` attributes + document.addEventListener delegation handler at EOF.

| FC-194 | Feature | P1 | M | Ready | **Build `operational-dashboard.js`** - JS engine for FC-173 Ops Dashboard. Loads all 5 RPCs in parallel via `Promise.all()`, renders spending by category, cash flow KPIs, 6-month trend chart, bills due, net worth breakdown. Mirror demo-mode pattern from `budget-actuals.js`. (5h) - Sprint Research 2026-02-17 - see reports/supabase-advanced-query-patterns-2026-02-17.md |
| FC-195 | Chore | P2 | S | Ready | **Migrate `budget-actuals.js` live-mode to RPC** - Current live mode fetches all transactions + SUMs in JS. Replace with a Supabase RPC call (`get_monthly_spending`) to push aggregation server-side. Maintains demo-mode fallback unchanged. (1h) - Sprint Research 2026-02-17 |
| FC-196 | Chore | P3 | XS | Ready | **Add `buildDemoOpsData()` to `demo-data.js`** - Derive Operational Dashboard demo data from existing `DEMO_DATA.transactions`, `DEMO_DATA.bills`, `DEMO_DATA.debts` etc. No new fake data needed - just aggregate the existing demo arrays. (1h) - Sprint Research 2026-02-17 |

| BUG-UIUX-FC180-ODD-GRID-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Done | **FC-180 category budget grid asymmetric on desktop** - FIXED commit 1ee139b (2026-02-18). All 9 `col-md-6` ? `col-md-6 col-lg-4` for symmetric 3�3 desktop layout. (Sprint UI/UX 0427, 2026-02-18) |
| BUG-UIUX-FC180-DUAL-SAVE-001 | Bug | P2 | S | Ready | **Settings page has two disconnected Save buttons** - "Save Settings" (emergency fund) and "Save Budgets" (category budgets) are separate cards with separate buttons and separate status spans. Users may save one without saving the other - no visual connection between them. Fix: either (A) merge into one unified "Save Settings" button that calls both `saveSettings()` and `saveCategoryBudgets()` in sequence, or (B) add a `<p class="text-info small">?? Don't forget to save your budgets below!</p>` note in the Financial Goals card. Est: 30 min. (Sprint UI/UX 0745, 2026-02-17) |

| FC-UIUX-051 | Feature | P3 | XS | Done | **bills.html 3-column XL layout** - FIXED commit 4212c8e (2026-02-19). Added "Next Due" 4th summary card showing soonest upcoming bill name + urgency-colored days label. Wired in `renderBills()` after billsSharedCount update. (Sprint QA 0542, 2026-02-19) |
| BUG-BOOTSTRAP-MODAL-NEW-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Done | **`new bootstrap.Modal()` calls should use `getOrCreateInstance()`** - FIXED Sprint QA 0705 (2026-02-18). `app.js:showSharedBillDeleteWarning` ? `getOrCreateInstance()`; `onboarding.js:startOnboarding` ? `dispose()` guard + `new Modal` with options; `onboarding.js:resumeOnboardingIfPending` ? `getOrCreateInstance().show()`. Prevents duplicate instances on repeated calls. |
| BUG-UIUX-BILLS-LISTENER-REBIND-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Done | **email-bills.js re-attaches bill card listeners on every re-render** - FIXED commit 284cfb2 (2026-02-18). `attachBillCardEventListeners()` removed entirely; replaced with single delegated handler on `#emailReviewList` covering all 4 event types (checkbox change, category change, approve/reject/edit click).

| BUG-UIUX-BILLS-APPROVE-SCHEMA-001 | Bug | P2 | XS | Done | **email-bills.js `approveBill()` schema fix** - Commit 284cfb2 partially fixed (removed isFinancing concept) but introduced regression: changed `nextDueDate` ? `next_due_date` incorrectly. Migration.sql confirms DB uses `"nextDueDate"` (camelCase, quoted). Regression fixed in Sprint QA 0705 (2026-02-18): reverted to `nextDueDate`, removed non-existent `is_financing` field, added `bill.frequency || 'monthly'` fallback. |

During 5-80s retry windows users see stale data with no indication. After MAX_RETRIES (5) exhausted, live updates silently stop - no toast, no badge, no reload prompt. Fix: (1) add `status:change` event dispatch from within the subscribe() callback, (2) add a "? Live / ? Reconnecting..." badge to the dashboard page-header area that wires to this event, (3) show a toast when retries are exhausted. Operations.html should also include this indicator. Est: 45 min.

Critical for financial health awareness. Fix: (1) Add y=0 annotation line using `afterDatasetsDraw` canvas hook in `renderCashFlowChart()`, (2) Color line segments red when `balanceData[i] < 0` using Chart.js `segment.borderColor` callback, (3) optionally add red fill below zero.
