| BUG-MODAL-INSTANCE-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Done | **showConfirmModal() creates new Modal instance on every call** - FIXED commit c13374b (2026-02-17). toast-notifications.js L379: `new bootstrap.Modal()` → `bootstrap.Modal.getOrCreateInstance()`. Previous code would create duplicate instances on a reused modal element (lazy-injected singleton), triggering Bootstrap "Modal is already shown" warning. (Sprint QA 0520, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-CSS-DUPE-001 | Bug | P3 | S | Ready | **Duplicate .empty-state{} blocks across multiple CSS files** - 4 standalone conflicting blocks: main.css L883 (padding:64px), main.css L2394 (padding:var, max-width:600px, animation), main.css L2829 (padding:4rem=64px, max-width:500px), components.css L1265 (padding:80px = WINS, loaded last). Also: duplicate @keyframes fadeIn at main.css L2440+L2799, duplicate @keyframes fadeInUp at main.css L2379+L3510. Fix: consolidate into one authoritative block in components.css, add responsive override in responsive.css. Est: 1h. (Sprint QA 0520, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-JS-DEADCODE-001 | Chore | P3 | XS | Ready | **Dead code: ConfirmDialog + duplicate setupDeleteConfirmations in app-polish-enhancements.js** - app-polish-enhancements.js defines `setupDeleteConfirmations()` (which references ConfirmDialog.show() from polish-utilities.js) but never calls it. event-handlers.js defines its OWN `setupDeleteConfirmations()` (different impl, actually called). The app-polish-enhancements.js version overwrites the global function silently but is dead. ConfirmDialog.show() in polish-utilities.js is now only used by this dead code. Fix: remove duplicate function + ConfirmDialog from app-polish-enhancements.js. Est: 30 min. (Sprint QA 0520, 2026-02-17) |
| FC-172 | Feature | P1 | S | Ready | **Cash Flow Projection Engine** - Implement `cash-flow.js` with `generateCashFlowProjection()`, `getOccurrences()`, `advanceByFrequency()`. Handles all 8 frequencies (daily → annual), month-end edge cases, parallel inflow/outflow ledger. Unit-testable. Powers FC-173. (2-3h) - Sprint Research 2026-02-17 - see reports/cash-flow-forecasting-research-2026-02-17.md |
| FC-173 | Feature | P1 | L | Ready | **Operational Dashboard Page** - Build `operations.html` + `operations.js` with: cash flow line chart (30/60/90d toggle), bills aging widget (3 buckets: ≤7d/8-30d/31-60d), budget vs. actuals horizontal bar chart, Safe to Spend KPI, upcoming 14-day transactions list. Depends on FC-172. (5-6h) - Sprint Research 2026-02-17 - see reports/cash-flow-forecasting-research-2026-02-17.md |
| FC-174 | Feature | P2 | XS | Ready | **Safety Buffer Setting** - Add `safety_buffer` field to settings table (default $500). User-configurable threshold for Safe to Spend calculation and low-balance alerts. Show in Settings page as part of FC-UIUX-023 expansion. (30 min) - Sprint Research 2026-02-17 |
| FC-175 | Feature | P2 | XS | Ready | **Current Balance Manual Entry** - Add `current_balance` field to settings table. Quick-entry modal on Operations page for users without Plaid production. Required starting point for cash flow projections (FC-172/173). (45 min) - Sprint Research 2026-02-17 |
| FC-180 | Feature | P1 | XS | Ready | **Category Budget Settings** - Add `category_budgets` JSON field to `settings` table + Settings UI to set monthly limits per spending category (dining, groceries, transportation, utilities, entertainment, shopping, healthcare, travel, other). (1h) - Sprint Research 2026-02-17 - see reports/budget-vs-actuals-sample-data-research-2026-02-17.md |
| FC-181 | Feature | P1 | S | Ready | **Budget vs Actuals Engine** - Build `budget-actuals.js` with `calculateBudgetVsActuals(month)`. Pulls category budgets from settings, sums actual spending from transactions table by category, calculates dollar/percent variance, flags over/warning/under status per category. (2h) - Sprint Research 2026-02-17 - see reports/budget-vs-actuals-sample-data-research-2026-02-17.md |
| FC-182 | Feature | P1 | S | Done | **Budget vs Actuals UI Card** - FIXED commit 88494b9 (2026-02-17). Added #bvaSection / #bvaCardBody to budget.html, wired renderBudgetVsActuals() call in loadAndRenderBudget(). Syncs with month selector. Shows Total Budget/Actual/Variance summary + per-category progress bars (green/amber/red). (Sprint Dev 0639, 2026-02-17) |
| FC-183 | Feature | P2 | S | Ready | **Historical Budget Comparison** - Month-over-month variance trend table (last 6 months per category): which categories consistently over/under budget. Simple table view, no chart needed initially. (1h) - Sprint Research 2026-02-17 |
| FC-184 | Feature | P1 | S | Ready | **Demo Data Module** - Build `demo-data.js` with realistic sample data for all 6 tables (assets, income, bills, debts, investments, transactions, snapshots). Data reflects young professional profile (salary + freelance income, mortgage, car loan, realistic spending). Dynamic transaction/snapshot generation. (3h) - Sprint Research 2026-02-17 - see reports/budget-vs-actuals-sample-data-research-2026-02-17.md |
| FC-185 | Feature | P1 | S | Ready | **Data Layer Wrapper for Demo Mode** - Build `data-layer.js` thin wrapper over all Supabase queries. When `isDemoMode()`, routes to DEMO_DATA instead of Supabase. Eliminates scattering demo checks across 10+ JS files. Each data fetch has one entry point. (2h) - Sprint Research 2026-02-17 - see reports/budget-vs-actuals-sample-data-research-2026-02-17.md |
| FC-186 | Feature | P2 | XS | Ready | **Demo Mode Banner + Empty State Toggle** - Show sticky "Preview Mode" info banner when demo is active. Add "Preview with Sample Data" button to all empty states. Toggle disables demo on click. (1h) - Sprint Research 2026-02-17 |
| FC-187 | Feature | P2 | XS | Ready | **Demo Mode Toggle in Settings** - Add "Demo Mode" toggle in Settings page under Display Preferences. Shows/hides sample data system-wide. (30 min) - Sprint Research 2026-02-17 |
| BUG-TOAST-DUPLICATE-001 | Bug | P2 | S | Ready | **Duplicate toast systems coexist** - `Toast` (toast-notifications.js) and `ToastManager` (polish-utilities.js) are two separate implementations of the same UI pattern. `app-polish-enhancements.js` uses `ToastManager`; the rest of the app uses `Toast`. Creates UX inconsistency (different positioning/animation/styling). Fix: make `ToastManager` a thin wrapper delegating to `Toast`, or migrate all callers to `Toast`. Est: 2h. (Sprint QA 0600, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-CATEGORIZER-GUARD-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Done | **categorizer.js calls `sb.auth.getUser()` without guard** - FIXED commit dc8dd1c (2026-02-17). Added `if (typeof sb === 'undefined') return null;` guard at top of checkLearnedPattern(). (Sprint Dev 0639, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-CATEGORIZER-TABLE-001 | Bug | P2 | XS | Ready | **`transaction_category_patterns` table not in documented schema** - categorizer.js queries a `transaction_category_patterns` table with columns `merchant_pattern`, `confidence`, `times_used`, `last_used`. Table is NOT listed in AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, or any migration file. Either undocumented or doesn't exist - categorizer silently returns `null` for every merchant. Fix: verify table exists in Supabase, add to documentation, or create migration. Est: 30 min. (Sprint QA 0600, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-CSRF-DUPLICATE-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **Duplicate CSRF token management** - `security-utils.js` and `csrf.js` both implement CSRF token init/storage using the same `sessionStorage['csrfToken']` key with different initialization sequences. `SecurityUtils.getCSRFToken()` and `CSRF.getToken()` both read the same value. Creates maintenance confusion. Fix: deprecate CSRF functions in security-utils.js, use `CSRF` module exclusively. Est: 30 min. (Sprint QA 0600, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-CHARTTHEME-DEADCODE-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Done | **chart-theme.js dead animation config** - `Chart.defaults.animation.duration = 400` and `.easing` were set AFTER `Chart.defaults.animation = false`, making them no-ops (can't set properties on `false`). Also the `prefers-reduced-motion` check was redundant (animation was already false). FIXED: removed dead lines, clarified comment, kept only definitive `animation = false` + reduced-motion override. Est: 5 min. (Sprint QA 0600, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-DEMO-BILLS-SCHEMA-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **DEMO_BILLS missing `nextDueDate` field** - `renderBills()` in app.js uses `bill.nextDueDate` for the "Next Due" column, but `DEMO_BILLS` in demo-data.js only has `due_day` (integer). When FC-185 data-layer.js routes demo data through the app, bills will show `-` for every due date. Fix: compute `nextDueDate` string from `due_day` in DEMO_BILLS during FC-185 implementation or precompute in demo-data.js. Est: 15 min. (Sprint QA 0600, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-SESSIONSEC-INLINE-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **session-security.js uses inline onclick in dynamic HTML** - `showSessionWarning()` generates a dismiss button with `onclick="sessionSecurity.hideSessionWarning()"` inline, violating the CSP compliance pattern established across the app. Fix: use `data-action="dismiss-session-warning"` + event delegation in session-security.js. Est: 15 min. (Sprint QA 0600, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-TRANS-INLINE-001 | Bug | P2 | XS | Ready | **transactions.js category select uses inline onchange handler** - `renderTransactionsTable()` injects `onchange="updateTransactionCategory('${t.id}', this.value)"` in every table row's `<select>`. Same CSP violation pattern as BUG-TOUR-INLINE-001 / BUG-SESSIONSEC-INLINE-001. Fix: remove inline handler, attach event delegation listener to `#transactionsTableBody` (delegated `change` event, read `data-transaction-id` from the select). Est: 30 min. (Sprint UI/UX 0631, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-SECURITY-INLINE-002 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **session-security.js showLogoutMessage() uses additional inline onclick** - The "Log In Again" button in `showLogoutMessage()` has `onclick="location.reload()"` inline - separate from BUG-SESSIONSEC-INLINE-001 (which covers the warning banner). Fix: use `data-action="reload-page"` + event delegation. Est: 10 min. (Sprint QA 0645, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-SECURITY-MODAL-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **session-security.js showLogoutMessage() uses new bootstrap.Modal() instead of getOrCreateInstance()** - Same pattern as the already-fixed BUG-MODAL-INSTANCE-001. `new bootstrap.Modal(el)` on a reused element can cause the Bootstrap "Modal already initialized" warning. Fix: change to `bootstrap.Modal.getOrCreateInstance()`. Est: 5 min. (Sprint QA 0645, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-POLISH-DBLINT-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **app-polish-enhancements.js double-initializes on every page** - The file runs `initializePolishEnhancements()` once immediately on deferred execution, then again via `setTimeout(initializePolishEnhancements, 1000)`. This double-binds `shown.bs.modal` / `show.bs.modal` event listeners to every modal and calls `preventDoubleSubmit(form)` twice on every form across all 11 pages. Fix: remove the `setTimeout` re-invocation (the deferred execution is sufficient). Est: 30 min. (Sprint QA 0645, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-UIUX-BVA-CAT-001 | Bug | P2 | XS | Ready | **Budget Item modal category is free-text input - won't match BVA_CATEGORIES enum** - `addBudgetItemModal` uses `<input type="text" id="budgetItemCategory">` but `renderBudgetVsActuals()` maps spending against a fixed 9-item enum in `BVA_CATEGORIES` (dining, groceries, transportation, utilities, entertainment, shopping, healthcare, travel, other). If a user types "Dining Out" instead of "dining", their spending will never show in the BvA card. Fix: replace the `<input>` with a `<select>` dropdown populated from `BVA_CATEGORIES`. Est: 15 min. (Sprint UI/UX 0650, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-UIUX-DEMO-STYLE-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **Demo banner uses 7 inline styles across all 11 pages** - `#demoBanner` div has `style="border-radius: 0; margin: 0; position: sticky; top: 0; z-index: 1060; border-left: none; border-right: none; border-top: none;"` - same inline style pattern already flagged in other CSP/maintainability bugs. Fix: create `.demo-banner` CSS class in main.css or components.css, remove inline styles from all 11 HTML pages. Est: 20 min. (Sprint UI/UX 0650, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-UIUX-BVA-SKEL-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **BvA card body (#bvaCardBody) has no initial skeleton state** - In budget.html, `#bvaCardBody` is empty on page load. The JS spinner injected by `renderBudgetVsActuals()` appears AFTER the card header is already visible, causing an inconsistent loading experience (header shows instantly, body lags). Fix: add 3 skeleton progress-bar rows as initial static HTML inside `#bvaCardBody`, matching the pattern used in the budget assignment table. Est: 15 min. (Sprint UI/UX 0650, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-UIUX-MODAL-CANCEL-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **Add Budget Item modal footer missing Cancel button** - `#addBudgetItemModal` footer contains only the "Add Item" `btn-primary` button. No Cancel/Close button in the footer. Users must click X in the header or press Escape to dismiss. Fix: add `<button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-secondary" data-bs-dismiss="modal">Cancel</button>` before "Add Item". Est: 2 min. (Sprint UI/UX 0650, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-RATELIMIT-CROSS-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **rate-limit-db.js calls disableButtonTemporarily() without typeof guard** - `withDatabaseRateLimit()` and `withHybridRateLimit()` both call `disableButtonTemporarily()` from `rate-limiter.js` without checking `typeof disableButtonTemporarily === 'function'`. Currently safe (both scripts always loaded together), but will throw ReferenceError if rate-limiter.js fails to load. Fix: add typeof guard before each call. Est: 10 min. (Sprint QA 0645, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-TRANS-MODAL-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Done | **addManualTransaction() uses Modal.getInstance() - can null-throw** - FIXED commit dc8dd1c (2026-02-17). Changed to getOrCreateInstance() in transactions.js L335. (Sprint Dev 0639, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-CATEGORIZER-DUP-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **CATEGORIES constant duplicated across transactions.js and categorizer.js** - `transactions.js` defines 11 categories (missing 'uncategorized'); `categorizer.js` defines 12 (includes 'uncategorized'). If one list is updated, the dropdown and the AI categorizer diverge silently. Fix: extract to a single shared `window.TRANSACTION_CATEGORIES` in categorizer.js, remove the duplicate from transactions.js. Est: 20 min. (Sprint UI/UX 0631, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-CATEGORIZER-DELAY-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **categorizeTransactionsBatch() artificial 100ms delay with no progress feedback** - The batch loop has `await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100))` between each transaction to avoid rate limiting. With 35 demo transactions that's 3.5+ seconds of silent processing. No toast or progress indicator shown. Fix: remove or reduce the delay (the Supabase read is already async, throttle is unnecessary for pattern reads), and add a progress toast during batch import. Est: 30 min. (Sprint UI/UX 0631, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-LAZY-REGISTRY-001 | Chore | P3 | XS | Ready | **LazyLoader registry missing demo-data.js, budget-actuals.js, onboarding.js** - `lazy-loader.js` has full infrastructure for on-demand script loading (Chart.js, Plaid Link) but `demo-data.js` and `budget-actuals.js` are loaded via `<script>` tags on ALL 11 pages even though they're only needed conditionally. Onboarding.js is always loaded even for returning users. Registering these in LazyLoader would save ~40-60KB of parse time on non-demo, non-onboarding sessions. Est: 1h. (Sprint UI/UX 0631, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-UIUX-ICONS-001 | Bug | P3 | S | Ready | **empty-states.js uses Heroicons SVG inline icons** - All 11 dynamic empty states inject raw SVG from Heroicons. Rest of app uses Bootstrap Icons (bi-* classes). Inconsistent icon system creates visual inconsistency and code bloat. Fix: replace SVG strings with `<i class="bi bi-*">` equivalents. Est: 2h. (Sprint UI/UX 0528, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-UIUX-EMPTYSTATE-CSP-001 | Bug | P3 | S | Ready | **generateEmptyStateHTML() uses inline onclick** - empty-states.js L~120 injects `onclick="handleEmptyStateAction()"` in generated HTML - violates CSP pattern.

| BUG-NOTIF-DEADCODE-001 | Chore | P3 | XS | Ready | **Dead `enhanceNotificationItem()` in notification-enhancements.js** - 25-line function defined but never called anywhere. Safe to remove. Est: 15 min. (Sprint UI/UX 0528, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-NOTIF-STYLE-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **notification-enhancements.js uses inline color styles** - `showToastNotification()` uses template literal `style="color: ${color}"` instead of CSS classes. Fix: map color values to CSS utility classes. Est: 30 min. (Sprint UI/UX 0528, 2026-02-17) |
| BUG-TOUR-INLINE-001 | Bug | P3 | XS | Ready | **tour.js `createTooltip()` uses inline onclick** - `onclick="skipTour()"` in dynamically generated tooltip HTML - violates CSP pattern. Fix: use `data-action="skip-tour"` + event delegation. Est: 30 min. (Sprint UI/UX 0528, 2026-02-17) |

| FC-193 | Chore | P1 | XS | Ready | **Deploy 5 Supabase RPCs for Operational Dashboard** - Paste 5 function definitions into Supabase SQL Editor and verify. Functions: `get_monthly_spending`, `get_monthly_cash_flow`, `get_spending_trend`, `get_bills_due_soon`, `get_net_worth_breakdown`. All use `SECURITY INVOKER` + `auth.uid()` (RLS-safe, no user_id param). (1h) - Sprint Research 2026-02-17 - see reports/supabase-advanced-query-patterns-2026-02-17.md |

Users may save one without saving the other — no visual connection between them. Fix: either (A) merge into one unified "Save Settings" button that calls both `saveSettings()` and `saveCategoryBudgets()` in sequence, or (B) add a `<p class="text-info small">💡 Don't forget to save your budgets below!</p>` note in the Financial Goals card.

During 5-80s retry windows users see stale data with no indication. After MAX_RETRIES (5) exhausted, live updates silently stop — no toast, no badge, no reload prompt. Fix: (1) add `status:change` event dispatch from within the subscribe() callback, (2) add a "● Live / ○ Reconnecting..." badge to the dashboard page-header area that wires to this event, (3) show a toast when retries are exhausted. Operations.html should also include this indicator. Est: 45 min. (Sprint UI/UX 0427, 2026-02-18) |
| FC-UIUX-046 | Feature | P1 | S | Ready | **operations.html HTML wireframe skeleton** — Full HTML shell before FC-173 development begins. Must include: correct sidebar nav (Operations link active), proper page-header structure, 5 section containers (`#safeToSpend`, `#cashFlowChart`, `#billsAging`, `#bvaHorizontal`, `#upcomingTx`), 30/60/90d toggle button group, realtime.js injection in correct script load order, connection status badge in header. No JS data wiring — structure only. This is the prerequisite for FC-173 Builder task. Est: 2h. (Sprint UI/UX 0427, 2026-02-18) |
| BUG-UIUX-OPS-SAFE2SPEND-001 | Bug | P2 | XS | Ready | **Safe to Spend KPI missing state design spec** — The "Safe to Spend" hero card planned for operations.html has no design spec for its 3 financial states. Must be specified before FC-173 build or it defaults to plain text. Design: (negative) `card bg-danger text-white` with `<i class="bi bi-exclamation-triangle-fill">` + bold amount; ($0-$1k amber) `card border-warning` with amber left-border accent + yellow value; (>$1k healthy) standard card with `text-success fw-bold` amount. Formula tooltip: "Current Balance − Bills due in 7 days − Safety Buffer ($500)". Est: 30 min (design spec + CSS). (Sprint UI/UX 0427, 2026-02-18) |
| BUG-DB-SCHEMA-FC180-001 | Bug | **P1** | XS | **⚠️ BLOCKED** | **Run Supabase migration 006** — `category_budgets JSONB` column missing from settings table. FC-180 save returns 400. Migration SQL ready at `migrations/006_add_category_budgets_to_settings.sql`. **MUST be run manually in Supabase SQL Editor.** Cannot be auto-applied (requires DDL privileges). |
| FC-198 | Chore | P1 | XS | Ready | **Create `transaction_category_patterns` table + enable Realtime publications** — BUG-CATEGORIZER-TABLE-001: table may not exist in DB. Run CREATE TABLE with RLS + enable 3 realtime publications (transactions, bills, snapshots). Full SQL in `reports/categorization-realtime-research-2026-02-17.md`. (30 min) - Sprint Research 0751, 2026-02-17 |
| FC-199 | Chore | P1 | S | Ready | **Enhance `categorizer.js` — Layer 1 built-in keyword dictionary + batched Layer 2 query** — Adds 200-entry merchant keyword map (dining/groceries/transportation/utilities/entertainment/shopping/healthcare/travel/bills/income). Fixes BUG-CATEGORIZER-DELAY-001: removes 100ms artificial delay, replaces N sequential DB queries with single `.in()` batch query. Impact: 35 transactions 3,500ms → ~50ms (70x faster), 80-90% auto-categorized on first run with zero DB calls. Full implementation in `reports/categorization-realtime-research-2026-02-17.md`. (2h) - Sprint Research 0751, 2026-02-17 |
| FC-200 | Feature | P1 | S | Ready | **Create `realtime.js` — production-safe Supabase Realtime manager** — Self-contained Realtime event bus. Subscribes to transactions (INSERT), bills (UPDATE), snapshots (INSERT) filtered by user_id. Includes exponential backoff reconnection (channels drop every ~30min on free plan), unique channel names per session, beforeunload teardown, demo-mode skip guard. Exposes `FiresideRealtime.subscribe()` + `.on(event, callback)`. Used by operational-dashboard.js to live-refresh KPI cards on new transactions. Full implementation in `reports/categorization-realtime-research-2026-02-17.md`. (2h) - Sprint Research 0751, 2026-02-17 |
| FC-201 | Feature | P3 | M | Backlog | **Layer 3: Transformers.js zero-shot transaction categorization** — For the ~10-20% of transactions that pass through Layer 1 (keywords) and Layer 2 (learned patterns) uncategorized. Worker-based, lazy-loaded only when needed. Model: `Xenova/mobilebert-uncased` (11MB). Runs in browser via Web Worker + ONNX runtime — no server/API key needed. Full design in `reports/categorization-realtime-research-2026-02-17.md`. (4h) - Sprint Research 0751, 2026-02-17 |
| FC-202 | Chore | P1 | XS | Ready | **Supabase migration 008: `plaid_items` table** — Secure server-side storage for Plaid access tokens. Columns: user_id, item_id, access_token (NEVER exposed to client), institution_name, cursor (for /transactions/sync), status enum, error_code, last_synced. RLS + `plaid_items_safe` security view that strips `access_token`. (30 min) - Sprint Research 0433, 2026-02-18 - see reports/plaid-production-integration-research-2026-02-18.md |
| FC-203 | Feature | P1 | S | Ready | **Azure Function: `/api/create-link-token`** — Server-side Plaid Link token creation. Verifies Supabase JWT, calls Plaid `linkTokenCreate` with `client_name`, `products: [transactions]`, `webhook` URL, `redirect_uri` for OAuth. Supports update mode variant (takes existing item_id, re-auth flow). (2h) - Sprint Research 0433, 2026-02-18 - see reports/plaid-production-integration-research-2026-02-18.md |
| FC-204 | Feature | P1 | M | Ready | **Azure Functions: `/api/exchange-public-token` + `/api/transactions-sync`** — Exchange public_token for access_token (stored server-side only via service role key). Cursor-based `/transactions/sync` loop with pagination, upsert added/modified, delete removed. Maps Plaid transaction fields to Fireside transactions schema. (3h) - Sprint Research 0433, 2026-02-18 - see reports/plaid-production-integration-research-2026-02-18.md |
| FC-205 | Feature | P1 | S | Ready | **Azure Function: `/api/webhooks-plaid`** — Idempotent Plaid webhook receiver. Responds 200 within 10s, then processes: `TRANSACTIONS/SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE` → trigger sync; `ITEM/PENDING_DISCONNECT` → update status; `ITEM/ERROR` → mark `needs_reauth`. Optional: verify X-Plaid-Verification-Token JWT signature. (1h) - Sprint Research 0433, 2026-02-18 - see reports/plaid-production-integration-research-2026-02-18.md |
| FC-206 | Feature | P1 | S | Ready | **Rewrite `plaid.js`**: OAuth redirect return handling (`receivedRedirectUri`), `onExit` error type routing (INVALID_LINK_TOKEN → retry, INSTITUTION_ERROR → user message), `onEvent` analytics logging, update mode support (`openPlaidUpdateMode(itemId)`), fetch to `/api/create-link-token` with Supabase JWT, replace alert() → Toast. (2h) - Sprint Research 0433, 2026-02-18 - see reports/plaid-production-integration-research-2026-02-18.md |
| FC-207 | Chore | P2 | XS | Ready | **Create Azure Functions boilerplate**: `api/package.json` (with plaid + @supabase/supabase-js deps), `api/host.json` (v2 runtime), base shared utility `api/_shared/plaid-client.js` and `api/_shared/supabase-admin.js`. Copy pattern from `api-disabled` folder. (30 min) - Sprint Research 0433, 2026-02-18 |
| FC-208 | Chore | P1 | XS | Ready | **⚠️ MATT TODO: Plaid Dashboard compliance checklist** — (1) Complete Application Profile, (2) Complete Company Profile, (3) Complete Security Questionnaire, (4) Set use-case description in Link Customization (required post-Oct 31 2024), (5) Register OAuth redirect URI: `https://nice-cliff-05b13880f.2.azurestaticapps.net/transactions.html`, (6) Request Production Access. ~1h of dashboard work. REQUIRED before any real bank connections work. See reports/plaid-production-integration-research-2026-02-18.md |
| FC-209 | Feature | P3 | XS | Backlog | **Plaid Link conversion analytics** — Log `onEvent` data (OPEN, HANDOFF, EXIT, ERROR + view names) to Supabase `plaid_link_events` table. Enables drop-off analysis. (1h) - Sprint Research 0433, 2026-02-18 |
