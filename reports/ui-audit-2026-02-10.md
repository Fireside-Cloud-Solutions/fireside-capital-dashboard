---

## Issues Identified

### 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

#### Issue #1: Missing Skeleton Loading States
- **Location:** Transactions table (line ~220 in transactions.html)
- **Problem:** No loading skeleton shown while data fetches. This creates a poor perceived performance experience. The Dashboard has excellent skeleton examples that should be replicated here.
- **Fix:** 
  - Add `.chart-card.loading` wrapper class
  - Include `.chart-skeleton` div with height matching expected table
  - Remove `.loading` class once data loads
- **Reference:** index.html lines 284-297 (stat cards with skeleton loaders)
- **Impact:** Users perceive the page as slow/unresponsive during data fetch
- **Effort:** 2 hours
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] Loading skeleton visible during initial data fetch
  - [ ] Skeleton smoothly transitions to actual content
  - [ ] Skeleton height matches expected table height

#### Issue #7: Empty State Missing
- **Location:** Transactions table when no bank accounts connected
- **Problem:** Likely shows blank table or generic "No data" message. First-run experience needs to guide users to connect a bank account.
- **Fix:** 
  - Create empty state component with:
    - 64px bank icon (bi-bank2)
    - Heading: "No transactions yet"
    - Description: "Connect your bank account to start tracking transactions automatically"
    - Primary CTA: "Connect Bank Account" button
- **Reference:** Design system empty state pattern (utilities.css)
- **Impact:** Confusing first-run experience
- **Effort:** 3 hours
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] Empty state shows when no transactions exist
  - [ ] "Connect Bank Account" button triggers Plaid Link
  - [ ] Empty state is responsive on mobile
  - [ ] Icon, heading, and CTA follow design tokens

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### Issue #2: Page Header Layout Inconsistency
- **Location:** Compare transactions.html vs bills.html page headers
- **Problem:** Transactions page has empty `<div class="page-header-actions">` while Bills page properly uses it for action buttons. This creates inconsistent visual hierarchy across pages.
- **Fix:** 
  - Move "Sync from Bank" and "Add Transaction" buttons into `.page-header-actions` container
  - Ensure consistent spacing with other pages
- **Reference:** Bills page header structure (lines 108-116 in bills.html)
- **Impact:** Inconsistent page layouts confuse users navigating between sections
- **Effort:** 1 hour
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] Buttons moved to `.page-header-actions` container
  - [ ] Visual alignment matches Bills and Assets pages
  - [ ] Mobile layout responsive

#### Issue #4: Button Hierarchy Violation
- **Location:** Transactions page action buttons (line ~168)
- **Problem:** Three primary-level buttons competing for attention:
  - "Sync from Bank" uses `btn-primary` (flame orange)
  - "Add Transaction" uses `btn-secondary` (sky blue)
  - "Auto-Categorize" uses `btn-outline-secondary`
  - Design system specifies MAX 1 primary button per page
- **Fix:** 
  - Change "Sync from Bank" from `btn-primary` to `btn-secondary`
  - Keep "Add Transaction" as `btn-secondary`
  - Keep "Auto-Categorize" as `btn-outline-secondary`
- **Design Principle:** Tri-color hierarchy (from design-tokens.css)
  - Flame Orange (#f44e24): PRIMARY actions - 1 per page max
  - Sky Blue (#01a4ef): SECONDARY actions - 2 per page max
  - Neutral Gray: TERTIARY actions - unlimited
- **Impact:** Visual competition reduces action clarity
- **Effort:** 15 minutes
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] Only one `btn-primary` per page (if any)
  - [ ] Visual hierarchy clear: most important action stands out
  - [ ] Follows tri-color brand system

#### Issue #6: Last Sync Time Feedback
- **Location:** "Last synced: Never" text (line ~172)
- **Problem:** Static text doesn't update dynamically; no relative time ("2 minutes ago"). Users can't tell if sync is working.
- **Fix:** 
  - Implement `getRelativeTime()` utility function
  - Store last sync timestamp in localStorage or Supabase
  - Update text on successful sync
  - Show relative time: "2 minutes ago", "1 hour ago", etc.
- **Impact:** Users don't trust that sync is working
- **Effort:** 2 hours
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] Timestamp updates after successful sync
  - [ ] Relative time display ("2 minutes ago")
  - [ ] Timestamp persists across page reloads
  - [ ] Shows "Never" on first visit

### 🟢 LOW PRIORITY

#### Issue #3: Form Card Title Hierarchy
- **Location:** Transactions page filters card (line ~180)
- **Problem:** Uses `<h5 class="card-title">Filters</h5>` but design system suggests h3 for card titles (24px/--text-h3). Inconsistent with typography scale.
- **Fix:** 
  - Option A: Change to `<h3 class="h5 card-title">Filters</h3>` (semantic h3, visual h5)
  - Option B: Update design-tokens.css to formally specify `.card-title` size
- **Typography Scale Reference:**
  - --text-h3: 1.5rem (24px)
  - --text-h5: 1.125rem (18px)
- **Impact:** Minor semantic HTML inconsistency
- **Effort:** 30 minutes (requires decision on approach)
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] Heading semantics match visual hierarchy
  - [ ] Consistent across all pages
  - [ ] Accessibility maintained (screen readers)

#### Issue #5: Spacing Grid Violations
- **Location:** Filter row (line ~183) uses Bootstrap's `.g-3` (1rem = 16px)
- **Problem:** Inconsistent with 8px spacing grid system defined in design-tokens.css
- **Fix:** 
  - Change from `.g-3` to `.g-2` (0.5rem = 8px)
  - Aligns with `--space-sm` token
- **Design System:** 8px base scale (--space-2: 0.5rem)
- **Impact:** Subtle visual inconsistency in spacing
- **Effort:** 5 minutes
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [ ] All spacing uses 8px increments
  - [ ] Visual alignment consistent with other pages
  - [ ] Mobile responsive

## Recommendations

### Short-term (Sprint Priority)
1. **Fix HIGH priority issues** (#1, #7) — improve first-run experience and perceived performance
2. **Address MEDIUM priority issues** (#2, #4) — ensure visual consistency across pages

### Long-term (Backlog)
3. **Standardize component patterns** — create reusable empty state, skeleton loader, and page header components
4. **Design system enforcement** — add linting rules to catch button hierarchy violations
5. **Performance monitoring** — track actual vs. perceived load times
