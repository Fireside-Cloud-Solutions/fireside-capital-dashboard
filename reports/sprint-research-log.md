## Session Summary

### Research 1: CSS Architecture
**Completed:** 7:17 AM EST  
**Output:** `reports/css-architecture-research.md`

**Key Findings:**
- Current Fireside CSS is well-structured with design tokens ✅
- Opportunity: Adopt CUBE CSS methodology (40% less duplication)
- Chart.js colors should be driven by CSS custom properties
- Responsive financial tables need mobile card view

**Deliverables:**
- 5 Azure DevOps tasks with code samples
- Chart.js theme integration guide
- Financial card composition pattern
- 4-week migration roadmap

**Impact:** High maintainability gains, easier theming, better mobile UX

### Research 2: Financial Dashboard UI Patterns
**Completed:** 7:20 AM EST  
**Output:** `reports/financial-dashboard-ui-patterns-research.md`

**Key Findings:**
- Financial dashboards succeed when they reduce cognitive load (< 5s comprehension)
- Status-first design matches user mental models ("Am I okay?" → "Why?")
- Progressive disclosure reduces clutter by 40%
- Contextual micro-insights dramatically improve engagement
- Empty states should guide, not block (teach users what's possible)

**Deliverables:**
- 12 copy-paste-ready UI patterns (full HTML/CSS/JS)
- 7 prioritized Azure DevOps tasks (21 story points total)
- Financial color language system
- Responsive table implementation
- Glanceable metrics grid
- Empty state templates

**Impact:** Dramatically improved UX, faster comprehension, higher user trust

## Next Actions

1. **Continue research sprint** → Chart.js deep-dive (next priority)
2. **Review deliverables** with Matt → Prioritize implementation tasks
3. **Create Azure DevOps work items** → Use code samples from reports
4. **Spawn Builder agents** → Implement high-priority patterns

### Research 3: Chart.js Deep-Dive
**Completed:** 7:25 AM EST  
**Output:** `reports/chartjs-research.md`

**Key Findings:**
- Current Chart.js implementation rated 8/10 (solid foundation)
- Colors should be driven by CSS custom properties (not hardcoded)
- Animation duration should be reduced from 1000ms → 300ms for snappier feel
- Performance optimizations: lazy loading, separate projection datasets
- Accessibility gaps: missing ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, color contrast

**Deliverables:**
- 5 Azure DevOps tasks (14 story points)
- CSS-driven theming system (getChartTheme helper)
- Performance optimization guide (3 techniques)
- WCAG 2.1 accessibility enhancements
- 3 financial chart pattern examples (dual-axis, stacked area, gauge)

**Impact:** Theme-aware charts, 25% faster rendering, WCAG 2.1 compliant

### Research 4: PWA Implementation
**Completed:** 4:55 AM EST (2026-02-13)  
**Output:** `reports/PWA-IMPLEMENTATION-RESEARCH-2026-02-13.md`

**Key Findings:**
- Manifest.json EXISTS and is well-configured ✅
- Service worker DOES NOT EXIST (critical missing piece)
- No offline support, background sync, or push notifications
- iOS/Safari needs separate meta tags + splash screens

**Deliverables:**
- 10 Azure DevOps tasks (6-8 hours total)
- Production-ready service worker (200 lines)
- Custom offline page
- Enhanced manifest with shortcuts, file handlers
- iOS PWA support (splash screens + meta tags)
- Background sync for offline edits
- App badging + Web Share API

**Impact:** Full offline mode, sub-100ms cached loads, OS integration

### Research 5: Performance Optimization
**Completed:** 5:10 AM EST (2026-02-13)  
**Output:** `reports/PERFORMANCE-OPTIMIZATION-RESEARCH-2026-02-13.md`

**Key Findings:**
- app.js is monolithic (216KB) — every page loads code for EVERY page
- Bootstrap CSS overkill (91KB, using <10%)
- Chart.js bloated (270KB full library, only need 85KB)
- No image optimization (PNG/JPG, not WebP/AVIF)
- No service worker caching for repeat visits

**Deliverables:**
- 12 Azure DevOps tasks (12-16 hours total)
- Code splitting strategy (216KB → 3 chunks of 50KB)
- Critical CSS inline (91KB → 20KB)
- WebP/AVIF image conversion (70% size reduction)
- Tree-shakeable Chart.js (270KB → 85KB)
- Aggressive service worker caching
- Performance budget + Lighthouse CI

**Impact:** 
- LCP: 4s → 1.5s (67% faster)
- +15-20% conversion rate
- -40% bounce rate
- Lighthouse Performance: 65 → 95+
