## Console Warnings (Non-Blocking)

### CSRF Warnings (8) — Expected ⚠️
```
CSRF: Form with ID "assetForm" not found
CSRF: Form with ID "debtForm" not found
CSRF: Form with ID "billForm" not found
CSRF: Form with ID "incomeForm" not found
CSRF: Form with ID "settingsForm" not found
CSRF: Form with ID "budgetForm" not found
CSRF: Form with ID "shareBillForm" not found
CSRF: Form with ID "emailReviewForm" not found
```

**Impact:** None (CSRF protection runs globally, expects forms on all pages)  
**Status:** Known behavior, non-blocking  
**Recommendation:** Refactor CSRF.js to only protect forms present on current page (future optimization)

### Chart Warnings (4) — Expected ⚠️
```
Chart canvas not found for: Net Worth Delta
Chart canvas not found for: Spending Categories
Chart canvas not found for: Savings Rate
Chart canvas not found for: Investment Growth
```

**Impact:** None (app.js attempts to render all charts, expects canvases on all pages)  
**Status:** Known behavior, non-blocking  
**Recommendation:** Add page detection to app.js chart rendering (future optimization)

---

2. **Mobile device testing:** Test on physical iOS/Android devices (currently only tested in browser)
3. **User acceptance testing:** Have founder test full workflow with real data

### Long-term (1+ months)
4. **Enhanced monitoring:** Add error tracking (Sentry or similar) for production issues
5. **Performance metrics:** Add Lighthouse CI to track performance scores over time
6. **Automated testing:** Add Playwright tests for critical user flows
