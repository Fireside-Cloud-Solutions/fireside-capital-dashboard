## 6. Data Gaps & Recommendations

### 🚨 Critical — Must Populate First

These tables are required for any meaningful financial analysis:

| Priority | Table | What's Needed | Example Entries |
|----------|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| **P0** | `income` | All income sources | W2 salary, side gig income, freelance |
| **P0** | `bills` | All recurring bills | Rent/mortgage, utilities, subscriptions, insurance |
| **P0** | `debts` | All outstanding debts | Student loans, car loans, credit cards |
| **P0** | `settings` | User preferences | Emergency fund goal |

### 🟡 Important — Populate for Full Picture

| Priority | Table | What's Needed | Example Entries |
|----------|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| **P1** | `assets` | Real estate, vehicles | Home (value + mortgage), car (value + loan) |
| **P1** | `investments` | Retirement & brokerage | 401k, IRA, brokerage accounts |

### 🟢 Auto-Generated — Will Populate Over Time

| Priority | Table | How It Gets Data |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| **P2** | `snapshots` | Auto-calculated daily from assets, investments, debts |
| **P2** | `budgets` | Created monthly via dashboard when assigning amounts |

## 7. Recommended Data Entry Order

To get the fastest value from the dashboard, enter data in this order:

1. **Income** → Establishes what you earn (enables cash flow analysis)
2. **Bills** → Establishes fixed monthly outflows (enables budget tracking)
3. **Debts** → Tracks what you owe with interest rates (enables payoff projections)
4. **Settings** → Set emergency fund goal (enables goal tracking)
5. **Assets** → Home, car values with loans (enables net worth calculation)
6. **Investments** → 401k, IRA, brokerage (completes net worth picture)

Once steps 1-3 are complete, the system can:
- ✅ Calculate monthly cash flow (income minus bills minus debt payments)
- ✅ Generate budget assignments
- ✅ Track upcoming payments and send alerts
- ✅ Project debt payoff timelines

Once steps 4-6 are complete, the system can additionally:
- ✅ Calculate and track net worth over time
- ✅ Generate daily snapshots
- ✅ Project investment growth
- ✅ Calculate total equity in assets

## 8. System Health

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Supabase connection | ✅ Connected |
| All 8 tables exist | ✅ Verified |
| Schema integrity | ✅ All columns present with correct types |
| Row-Level Security | ⚠️ Not verified (needs Auditor review) |
| Data present | 🔴 All tables empty |

---

## Summary

**Fireside Capital is a blank canvas.** The infrastructure is solid — all 8 Supabase tables are properly created with correct schemas and accessible via the REST API. However, no financial data has been entered yet.

**Next step:** Begin populating data, starting with income, bills, and debts. This can be done manually via the web dashboard or automated via Plaid bank integration (currently in sandbox mode).
